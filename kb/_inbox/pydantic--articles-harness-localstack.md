# Running AI agents against emulated AWS with Pydantic AI Harness and LocalStack

"You're absolutely right. I'll drop the old table and redeploy." And it can. It has credentials, it's fast, and it's confident in the way that reads right, up until CloudFormation spends four minutes half-applying a stack it then rolls back. Now you're reading the events tab at human speed, in an account with a real bill, to find out what your absolutely-right agent just did.

Give an agent a real cloud task, like "add a rate limiter to the checkout API," and it writes clean CDK in seconds. Then it stops being fast. Every deploy waits minutes on a control plane in another region. Every experiment is a line item. Every mistake lands in an account something real depends on, and the cloud charges for the conversation.

Wiring it up takes almost nothing. `Shell` gives the agent a terminal, your AWS
credentials are already in the environment, and `aws` is one command away:

```
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import Shell
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    capabilities=[Shell()],
)
result = agent.run_sync('Deploy the checkout stack and smoke-test the endpoint.')
```
It works. The agent creates the bucket, ships the function, wires the trigger. Then you remember it's doing all of that in a real account.


So you put a human in front of it. You approve each deploy and read each plan, which makes you the slowest component in the system again. The agent could try ten designs; you let it try one, because ten costs ten times as much, takes ten times as long, and leaves ten times the mess. It could fail fast and learn; you can't let it fail, because failure here has a blast radius.

Speed, fearlessness, a willingness to try the wrong thing on the way to the right one: that is what makes an agent good at this, and it is everything a real cloud account is built to punish. You supervise it not because it's bad at the task but because the environment is unforgiving, it's your name on the account, and your credit card pays the invoice.


The agent isn't the problem. The cloud is. The [LocalStack capability](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/tree/main/pydantic_ai_harness/localstack/)
gives an agent what LocalStack calls a local cloud development sandbox for AI agents: an
emulated AWS, the real service APIs, running in a container. It injects the endpoint and
credentials, so the agent just issues plain `aws` commands.
One line puts it in reach:

```
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.localstack import LocalStack
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    capabilities=[LocalStack(manage_container=True)],
)
```
`manage_container=True` starts a fresh LocalStack container for the run and stops it at
the end. (It needs a free LocalStack auth token in `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`, free from your
LocalStack account, or an older tokenless `image=`.) The agent's `aws` commands don't change. What changes is everything the
account made expensive:

- The four-minute deploy takes seconds. There's no remote control plane to wait on.
- The bill is zero. Nothing is provisioned anywhere you pay for.
- The blast radius is nothing. There's no production, only a container you throw away.

And because each run gets its own container, "reset to before the agent touched it" is the next run, not an afternoon of cleanup. Nothing carries over between runs.


A throwaway cloud does more than speed the agent up. It removes a constraint you didn't notice you were obeying.

You would never point ten agents at one AWS account at once. Ten agents, one production, shared state, ten times the bill: obviously not. But a cloud that costs nothing to run and starts clean every time takes that off the table. So don't give one agent one cloud. Give each agent its own.

Say you want to choose a rate-limiter design, and you have three candidates: a fixed-window counter, a sliding-window log, a token bucket, each backed by DynamoDB. Instead of asking one agent to reason about all three on paper, hand each to its own engineer with its own LocalStack, and let each build its design, deploy it, and drive requests through it until it should start rejecting. Then compare the three that ran, on what happened rather than what was promised.

On real AWS you could run this. You never would. Here each engineer is an agent with its own container:

```
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.localstack import LocalStack
from pydantic_ai_harness.dynamic_workflow import DynamicWorkflow
logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
designs = {
    'fixed': 'DynamoDB fixed-window counter (conditional increment, reset each window)',
    'sliding': 'DynamoDB sliding-window log (timestamped items with TTL, count the recent ones)',
    'bucket': 'DynamoDB token bucket (conditional decrement, refill over time)',
}
# One engineer per design, each with its own throwaway cloud on its own port.
engineers = [
    Agent(
        'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
        name=f'build_{key}',
        description=f'Builds and tests one design: {spec}',
        instructions=(
            'Deploy your design to your LocalStack with the AWS CLI, send requests through '
            'it past the limit, and report whether it actually starts rejecting and the '
            'DynamoDB calls it takes to decide.'
        ),
        capabilities=[
            LocalStack(manage_container=True, endpoint_url=f'http://localhost.localstack.cloud:{port}'),
        ],
    )
    for port, (key, spec) in zip((4566, 4576, 4586), designs.items())
]
judge = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    name='judge',
    description='Compares the tested designs and names a winner.',
)
architect = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-4-8',
    instructions='Have each design built and tested in parallel, then recommend the one the evidence supports.',
    capabilities=[DynamicWorkflow(agents=[*engineers, judge], max_agent_calls=20)],
)
```
The distinct ports aren't incidental. Each engineer gets its own container, so three of them run at once without stepping on each other.

Given the task, the architect doesn't make a dozen tool calls and narrate the results
back to itself. `DynamicWorkflow` hands it one tool, `run_workflow`, and it writes a
script:

```
import asyncio
prompt = 'Deploy your design, send requests past the limit, and report whether it actually starts rejecting.'
reports = await asyncio.gather(
    build_fixed(task=prompt),
    build_sliding(task=prompt),
    build_bucket(task=prompt),
)
await judge(task='Recommend one rate-limiter design, citing which actually held the limit:\n\n'
                 + '\n\n---\n\n'.join(reports))
```
Three real deployments, built and tested in parallel, each on its own cloud. The whole
tree runs inside one `run_workflow` call, so only the recommendation reaches the
architect, not the deploy logs. In the run behind this post, all three held the limit and
rejected the sixth request, but on different bills: the fixed-window counter and the token
bucket each decide with a single conditional DynamoDB write, while the sliding-window log
spends two, a put and a count, on every request. The judge picked the counter, on clouds
that came up in seconds and deleted themselves when the run ended.

The disposable cloud removes the cloud bill, but the model still costs tokens.
`max_agent_calls` caps the number of sub-agent runs exactly, even under fan-out, so a
workflow that explores ten designs instead of three stops at the ceiling you set.


There's a version of this that outlives one run: a migration that saves its progress
between steps and resumes after a crash. Pydantic AI's durable execution and
`DynamicWorkflow`'s durable workflows are heading there.

For now the smaller thing is enough, and it's the whole point: a place where mistakes are cheap. The agent can be wrong. It can drop the wrong table, ship a limiter that never rejects, break the deploy outright, and find out in seconds, for free, on a cloud that starts clean the next time you run it.

"You're absolutely right" stops being the sentence you brace for. It becomes a hypothesis you can afford to test.
