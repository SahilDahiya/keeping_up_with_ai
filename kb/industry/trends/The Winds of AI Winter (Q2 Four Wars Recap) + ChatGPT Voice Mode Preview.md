## Transcript

**Charlie** [00:01:08]: Welcome back, listeners. This is your AI co-host, Charlie. It's been a few months since we took a step back from the interview format and talked about the show. We're happy to share that we have crossed one million downloads and two million reads on Substack. Woo-hoo. We are really grateful to those of you who keep tuning in and sharing us with your friends, especially if who watch and comment on our new YouTube channel, where we are trying to grow next. For a special millionaire edition, SWIX and Alessio are finally back in person in sunny Singapore to discuss the big vibe shift in the last three months, that we are calling the Winds of AI Winter. We also discuss my nemesis, ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode, with a special treat for those who stay till the end. Now, more than ever, watch out and take care.

**Alessio** [00:02:02]: Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Latent Space Podcast. This is Alessio, partner and CTO in Residence and [Decibel Partners](https://decibel.vc/), and today we're in the Singapore studio with SWIX.

**Swyx** [00:02:11]: Hey, this is our long-awaited one-on-one episode. I don't know how long ago the previous one was. Do you remember? Three, four months?

**Alessio** [00:02:20]: Yeah, it's been a while.

**Swyx** [00:02:22]: People really enjoyed it. It's just really, I think our travel schedules have been really difficult to get this stuff together. And then we also had like a decent backlog of guests for a while. I think we've kind of depleted that backlog now and we need to build it up again. But it's been busy and there's been a lot of news. So we actually get to do this like sort of rapid fire thing. I think some people, you know, the podcast has grown a lot in the last six months. Maybe just reintroducing like what you're up to, what I'm up to, and why we're here in Singapore and stuff like that.

**Alessio** [00:02:51]: Yeah. My first time here in Singapore, which has been really nice. This country is really amazing, I would say. First of all, everything feels like the busiest part of the city. Everything is skyscrapers. There's like plants in all the buildings, or at least in the areas that I've been in, which has been awesome. And I was at one of the offices kind of on the south side and from the 38th floor, you can see Indonesia on one side and you can see Malaysia on the other side. So it's quite, quite small. One of the people there said their kid goes to school at the border with Malaysia basically, so they could drive to Malaysia every day. So they go pick her up from school. Yeah. And we came here, we hosted with you, the Sovereign AI Summit Wednesday night. We had a lot of folks.

**Swyx** [00:03:31]: NVIDIA, Goldman, Temasek, Singtel.

**Alessio** [00:03:34]: And we got to talk about this trend of sovereign AI, which maybe we might cover on another episode, but basically how do you drive, if you're a country, how do you drive productivity growth in a time where populations are shrinking, the workforce is shrinking and AI can kind of supplement a lot of this. And then the question is, okay, should I put all this money in foundation models? Should I put it in data centers and infrastructure? Should I put it in GPUs? Should I put it in agents and whatnot? So we'll touch on some of these trends in the episode, but it was a fun event. And I did not expect some of the most senior people at the largest financial institution in Singapore ask about state space models and some of the alternatives. So it's great to see how advanced the conversation is sometimes.

**Swyx** [00:04:16]: Yeah. I think that that is mostly people trying to listen to jargon that is being floated around as like, oh, what could kill transformers? And then they jump straight there without actually exploring the fundamentals, the basics of what they will actually put to work. That's fine. It's a forum to ask questions. So you want to ask about the future, but I feel like it's not very practical to spend so much time on those things. Part of the things that I do in space, especially when I travel, is to try to ask questions about what countries that are not the US and not San Francisco can do, because everyone feels a bit left out. You feel it here as well. And I'm trying to promote alternatives. I think AI engineering is one way that countries can capitalize on the industry without building a hundred billion dollar cluster, which is one-fifth the GDP of Singapore. And so my pitch at the summit was that we would sample with the AIGeneration. We're also working on bringing the AIGeneration conference to Singapore next year together with iClear. So yeah, we're just trying my best and I'm being looped into various government meetings to try to make that happen.

**Alessio** [00:05:25]: Well, we'll definitely be here next year. I'll be back here very often. It's really nice.

**Swyx** [00:05:31]: Yeah. Awesome. Okay. Well, we have a lot of news. How do you think we should cover?

**Alessio** [00:05:36]: Maybe just recap since the framework of the four words of AI is something that came up end of last year. So basically, we'll link in the show notes, but the end of year recap for 2023 was basically the four words of AI, which we picked GPU-rich versus GPU-poor, the data quality wars, the multimodality wars, and the reg slash ops wars. So usually everything falls back under those four categories. So I'm pretty happy that seven months later, it's something that still matters.

**Swyx** [00:06:07]: It still kind of holds up.

**Alessio** [00:06:08]: Yeah. Most AI stuff from eight months ago, it's really not that relevant anymore. And today we'll try and bucket some of the recent news on it. We haven't done a monthly thing in like three months. So three months is a lot of stuff.

**Swyx** [00:06:23]: That's mostly because I got busy with the conference. But I do want to get back on that horse or maybe just do it weekly so that I don't have such a big lift that I don't do it. I think the activation energy is the problem really. So yeah, I think frontier model wise, it seems like Cloud has really carved out a persistent space for itself. For a long time, I thought it was kind of like a clear number two to open AI. And with 3.5 on it, at least in some of the hard benchmarks on LMSys or coding benchmarks on LMSys, it is the undisputed number one model in the world, even with 4.0 mini. And we can talk about 4.0 mini and benchmarking later on. But for Cloud to be there and hold that position for what is more than a month now in AI time is a big deal. There's not much that people know publicly about what Enthopic did for Cloud's on it. But I think it's still a huge achievement. It marks the beginning of a non-open AI centric world to the point where people on Twitter have canceled ChatGPT. That's been a trend that's been going on for a while. We talked about the unbundling of ChatGPT. But now new open source projects and tooling, they're just built for Cloud. They don't even use open AI. That's a strategic threat to open AI, I think, a little bit. Obviously, open AI is so big that it doesn't really care about that. But for Enthopic, it's a big win. I think to see that going and to see Enthopic differentiating itself and actually implementing research. So the rumor is that the scaling monosematicity paper that they put out two months ago was a big part of Cloud 3.5's on it. I've had off-the-record chats with people about that idea, and they don't agree that it is the only cause. So I was thinking this is the only thing that they did. But people say that there's about four or five other tricks that they haven't disclosed yet that went into 3.5's on it. But the scaling monosematicity paper is a very, very good read. It's a very long read. But it basically says that you can find control vectors, control features now that you can turn on to make it better at code without really retraining it. You just train a whole bunch of sparse autoencoders, find a bunch of features, and just say, let's up those features, and suddenly you're better at code, or suddenly you care a lot about the Golden Gate Bridge. These are the same things to the model. That is a huge, huge win for interpretability, because up to now, we were only doing interpretability on toy models, like a few million parameters, a model of Go or chess or whatever. Cloud 3's on it was interpreted and usefully improved using this technique. Wow.

**Alessio** [00:09:02]: Yeah, I think it would be amazing if we could replicate the same on the open models to then, because now we can use Llama 3.1 to generate synthetic data for training and fine-tuning. I think, obviously, Anthropic has a lot of compute and a lot of money. So once they figure out, OK, this is what we should make the model better at, they can put a lot of resources. I think an open source is probably going to be a more distributed effort. I feel like Noose has held the crown of the best fine-tuning data site owners for a while, but at some point that should change, hopefully. Other groups should step up. And I think if we can apply the same principles to a model as big as 405B and bring them into maybe the 7B form factor, that would be great. But yeah, Cloud is great. I canceled JGBD a while ago. Really small podcaster run for latent space. It runs both on Cloud and on OpenAI, and Cloud is definitely better most of the time. It's not a benchmark. It's just vibes. But when the vibes are good, the vibes are good.

**Swyx** [00:09:58]: We run most of the AI news summaries on Cloud as well. And I always run it against OpenAI. Sometimes OpenAI wins. I do a daily comparison. But yeah, Cloud is very strong at summarization and instruction following, which is something I care a lot about. So when you talk about frontier models, MMLU no longer cut it. We have reached 92 on MMLU. It's going to 95, 97. It just means you're memorizing MMLU. There's some fundamental irreducible level of mistakes because of MMLU's quality. We talked about this with Clementine on the Hugging Face episode. And so we need to see what else. What is the next frontier? I think there are 10 directions that I outlined below, but we'll talk about that later. Yeah. Should we move on to number three?

**Alessio** [00:10:39]: Yeah. 3.1. I guess that to make sure to differentiate between the models.

**Swyx** [00:10:44]: Yeah.

**Alessio** [00:10:45]: But yeah, we have a whole episode with Thomas Shalom from the meta team, which was really, really good. And I'm glad we got the podcast to come out at the same time as the model.

**Swyx** [00:10:54]: Yeah. I think we're the only ones to coordinate for the paper release for the big launch, the 4.05 launch. Zuck did a few interviews, but we're the only ones that did the technical team interview.

**Alessio** [00:11:04]: Yeah. I mean, they were like surfing or something with the Bloomberg person. We should get invited to the audience, the technical breakdown.

**Swyx** [00:11:15]: So behind the scenes, for listeners, one thing that we have attention about is who do we invite? Because obviously if we get Mark Zuckerberg, it'll be a big name and it will cause people to download us more, but it will be a less technical interview because he's not on the research team. He's CEO of Meta. And so I think it's this constant back and forth. We want to grow as a podcast, but we want to serve a technical audience. And we're trying to thread that line because our currency as podcasters is the people that listen to it. And we need big names, but we also need to serve our audience well. And I think if we don't do it well, this actually goes all the way back to George Hotz. After he finished recording with us, he said, you have two paths in the podcast world. Either you go be Lex Friedman or you stay small on niche. And we definitely like our niche. We think it's a good niche. It's going to grow. But at the same time, I still want us to grow. I want us to grow on YouTube. And so that's always a meta thing. Not to get too meta.

**Alessio** [00:12:11]: Not that meta. The other meta.

**Swyx** [00:12:13]: Yeah. So number three.

**Alessio** [00:12:14]: I think to me, the biggest thing is the training on outputs. Every company is just hiding the fact that they've been fine tuning and training on GPT-4 outputs. And you can not technically do it, but obviously OpenAI is not enforcing it. I think now for the first time, there's a clear path to how do we make a 7b model good without having to go through GPT-4 or going to Cloud 3. And we'll kind of talk about this later, but I think we're seeing maybe the, not the death, but settling the picks and shovels, it's kind of going away. And building the vertical things is where most of the value is actually getting captured, at least at the early stages. So being able to make small models better at specific things through a large model, it's more important than yet another 7b model that I can try and use. But at the end of the day, I still need to go through the large labs to fine tune. So that to me is the most interesting thing. It's such a large model. It's obviously amazing, but I don't know if a lot of people are switching from GPT-4 or Cloud 3.5 to run 4 or 5b. I also don't know what the hosting options are as far as scaling. I don't know if the fireworks and togethers of the world, how much capacity they actually have to serve this model. Because at the end of the day, it's a lot of compute if some of the big products will switch to it and you cannot easily run it yourself. So I don't know. But to me, the synthetic data piece is definitely the most interesting.

**Swyx** [00:13:41]: Yeah. I would say that it is not enough now to say that synthetic data is real. I actually shipped that in the original email and then I changed that in the sort of what you see now in the podcast description. But because it is so established now that synthetic data is real, therefore you need to go to the next level, which is, OK, what do you use it for and how do you use it? And I think that is what was interesting for Lama3 for me. If you read the paper, 90 pages of all filler no killer is something like that. This is what the people were saying. Very, very for once a frontier model with proper paper instead of a marketing blog post. And, you know, they actually spelled out how they do synthetic data for a few different domains. So they have synthetic data for code, for math, for multilinguality, for long context, for tool use, and then also for ASR and voice generation. And I think that, OK, now you have the license to go distill Lama3, Lama4, Lama5B. But how do you do that? That is the sort of the next frontier. Now you have the permission to do it. How do you do it? And I think that people are going to reference Lama3 a lot, but then they can use those techniques for everything else. You know, in our episode with Thomas, he talked about, like, I was very focused on synthetic data for pre-training because that's my context. That's my conversations with Technium from Noose and all the other people doing synthetic data for pre-training and fine tuning. But he was talking about post-training as well. And for everything here was post-training. In fact, I wish we had spent more time with Thomas on this stuff. We just didn't have the paper beforehand. But I think, like, when I call Lama3, the synthetic data model is you have the license for it, but then you also have the roadmap, the recipe, because it's in the paper. And now, like, now everybody knows how to do this. And probably, you know, obviously, like, opening eyes probably laughing at us because they did this a year ago. But now it's in the open.

**Alessio** [00:15:33]: I mean, they can laugh all they want, but they're coming for them. I think, I mean, that's definitely the biggest vibe shift, right? It's like, obviously Lama3.1 is good. Obviously, Claude is good. Maybe a year and a half ago, you didn't get the benefit of the doubt. It's like an open AI competitor to be state of the art. You know, it was kind of like, oh, Entropic, yeah, those guys are cute over there. They're trying to do their thing, but it's not open AI. And like, Lama2 is great, but like, it's really not a serious model. You know, it's like just good enough. I think now it's like every time Entropic releases something, people are like, okay, this is like a serious thing. Whenever like Meta releases something, it's like, okay, they're at the same level. And I don't know if open AI is kind of like sandbagging the GBT next.

**Swyx** [00:16:15]: They're releasing waitlists.

**Alessio** [00:16:16]: Yeah. And then they kind of, you know, yesterday or today, they announced the search GBT thing behind the waitlist.

**Swyx** [00:16:23]: This is the Singapore confusion. When was it? Yeah, when was it? Because it happened yesterday, US time. But today, Singapore time.

**Alessio** [00:16:30]: It's been really confusing. But yeah, and people are kind of like, oh, okay, open AI. I don't know if we can take you seriously.

**Swyx** [00:16:39]: Well, no, one of the AI grants employees, I think Hirsch, tweeted that, you know, you can skip the waitlist, just go to perplexity.com. And that was a really, really sick burn for the open AI search GBT waitlist. But their implementation will have something different. They probably like train a dedicated model for that, you know, like they will have some innovation that we haven't seen.

**Alessio** [00:17:01]: Data licensing, obviously.

**Swyx** [00:17:02]: Data licensing, yes. We're optimistic, you know, but the vibe shift is real. And I think that's something that is just worth commenting on and watching. And yeah, how the other labs catch up. I think what you said there is actually very interesting. The trend of successive releases is very important to watch. If things get less and less exciting, then it's a red flag for that company. And if things get more and more exciting, it means that these guys have a good team, they have a good plan, good ideas. So yeah, like I will call out, you know, the Microsoft PHY team as well. PHY 1 was kind of widely regarded to be overtrained on benchmarks, and PHY 2 and PHY 3 subsequently improved a lot as well. I would say also similar for Gemma, Gemma 1 and 2. Gemma 2 is currently leading in terms of the local llama sort of vibe check eval, informal straw poll. And that's only like a month after release. They released at the Engineering World's Fair. And, you know, like I didn't know what to think about it because Gemma 1 wasn't like super well-received. It was just kind of like here's like free tier Gemini, you know. But now Gemma 2 is actually like a very legitimately widely used model by the open source and local llama community. So that's great. Until Llama 3 and Llama 7B came along. And we'll talk about this also, like just the winds of winter is also like, what is the depreciation schedule on this model inference and training costs? Like it's very high.

**Alessio** [00:18:27]: I'm curious to get your thought on Mistral. Everybody's favorite sparkling weights company. They just released the, you know, Mistral large enough.

**Swyx** [00:18:37]: Mistral large 2. So this was one day after Llama 3, presumably because they were speaking at ICML, which is going on right now. By the way, Brittany is doing a guest host thing for us. She's running around the poster sessions doing what I do, which is very great because I couldn't go because of my visa issue. I have to be careful what I say here, but I think because we still want to respect their work. But Mistral large, I would say it's like not as exciting as Llama 3. I think that is very, very fair to say. It is, yes, another GPT-4 class model released as open weights with a research license on a commercial license, but still open weights. And that's good for the community, but it is a step down in terms of the general excitement around Mistral compared to Llama. I think that would be fair to say, and I would say that to Mistral themselves. So the general hope is, and I cannot say too much because I've had offline conversations with people close to this. The general hope is that they need something more, you know, of the 10 elements of like, what is next in terms of their frontier model boundaries. Mistral needs to make progress there. They made progress here with like instruction following and structured output and multilinguality and all those things. But I think to stand out, you need to basically pull a stunt. You need to be a superlatively good company in one dimension. And now, unfortunately, Mistral does not have that crown as open source kings. You know, like a year ago I was saying, Mistral are the kings of open source AI. Now Meta is, they've lost their crowns. By the way, they've also deprecated Mistral 7B, 8x7B and 8x22B, right? So now there's only like the closed source models that are API platform. So has Mistral basically started becoming more of a closed model proprietary platform? I don't believe that's true. I believe that they're still very committed to open source, but they need to come up with something more that people can use. And that's a grind. I mean, they have, what, $600 million to do it? So that's still good. But, you know, people are waiting for like what's next from them.

**Alessio** [00:20:34]: Yeah. To me, the perception was interesting. In the comments of the release, everybody was like, why do you have a non-commercial license? You're not making any money anyway from the inference. So I feel like the AI engineering tier list, you know, is kind of shifting in real time. And maybe Mistral, like you said before, was like, hey, thank God for these guys. They're saving us in open source. They're kind of like speed running GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3 in open source. But now it's like they're kind of moving away from that. I haven't really heard of that many people using them as scale commercially, just from, you know, discussions. So I'm curious to see what the next step is.

**Swyx** [00:21:11]: Yeah, but also you're sort of US based and maybe they're not focused there, right?

**Alessio** [00:21:15]: Yeah, exactly.

**Swyx** [00:21:16]: It's a very big elephant and we're only touching pieces of it. It's blind leading the blind. I will call out, you know, they have some interesting experimentations with Mamba and Mistral NEMO is actually on the efficiency frontier chart that I drew that is still relevant. So don't discount Mistral NEMO, but Mistral Large otherwise, like it's an update. It's a necessary update for Mistral Large V1. But other than that, they're just kind of holding the line, not really advancing the field yet. That'll be my statement there. So those are the frontier big labs. Yes. And then now we're going to shift a little bit towards the smaller deployable on device solutions.

**Alessio** [00:21:56]: Yeah. First of all, shout out to our friend, 3DAO, who released Flash Attention 3, Flash Attention 2. We kind of did a deep dive on the podcast. He came on in the studio back then. It's just great to see how small groups can make a big impact on a whole industry just like by making math better. So it's just great to see. I just wanted to give 3 a shout out.

**Swyx** [00:22:18]: Something I mentioned there and it's something that always comes up, even in the Sovereign AI Summit that we did was, does Nvidia's competitors have any threat to Nvidia? AMD, like MADX, like Etched, which caused a lot of noise with their Sohu chip as well. And just the simple fact is that Nvidia has won the hardware lottery and people are customizing for Nvidia. Like Flash Attention 3 only works for Nvidia, only works for H100s. And like this much work, this much scaling, this much validation going into this stuff is very difficult to replicate or very expensive to replicate for the other hardware ecosystems. So not impossible. I actually heard a really good argument from one, I think it is Martin Casado from A16Z, who was saying basically like, yeah, like absolutely Nvidia's hardware and ecosystem makes sense. And obviously that's contributed to, it's like, I don't know, like it's like the most valuable company in the world right now. But current trading runs are like 100 million to 200 million in cost. But when they go to 500 million, when they go to a billion, when they go to 1 trillion, then you can actually start justifying making custom ASICs for your run. And if they cut your costs by like half, then you make your money back in one run.

**Alessio** [00:23:33]: Yeah. Martin has always been a fan of custom ASIC. I think they wrote a really good post maybe a couple of years ago about cloud repatriation.

**Swyx** [00:23:42]: Oh yeah. I think he got a lot of shit for that, but it's becoming more consensus now, I think. So Noam Shazir blogging again, fantastic, gifts to the world. This guy, nonstop bangers. And so he's at Character AI and he put up a post talking about five tricks that they use to serve 20% of Google search traffic as LLM inference. A lot of people were very shocked by that number, but I think you just have to remember that most conversations are multi-turn, right? Like in the span of one Google search, I will send like 10 text messages. So obviously there's a good ratio here that matters. It's obviously a flex of Character AI's traction among the kids because I have tried to use Character AI since then and I still cannot for the life of me get it. Have you tried?

**Alessio** [00:24:29]: I tried it, but yes, definitely not.

**Swyx** [00:24:31]: Yeah, they launched like voice. I tried to talk to it. It was just so stupid. I didn't like it myself, but this is what it means.

**Alessio** [00:24:39]: But please don't come on the podcast to Noam Shazir. Sorry, we didn't mean.

**Swyx** [00:24:42]: No, no, no. Because like, I don't really understand like what the use case is for, apart from like the therapy, role play, homework assistant type of stuff that is the norm. But anyway, one of the most interesting things, so he detailed five tricks. One thing that people talk a lot about is native int8 training. I got it wrong in our Thomas podcast. I said fp8 is int8. And I think that is something that is an easy win. We should basically, when we're getting to the point where we're over-training models 100 times past Chinchilla ratio to optimize for inference, the next thing is actually like, hey, let's stop using so much memory when training because we're going to quantize it anyway for inference. So let's pre-quantize it in training. So that makes a lot of sense. The other thing as well is this concept of global, local, hybrid architecture, which I think is basically going to be the norm, right? So he has this formula of one to five ratio of global attention to local attention. And he says that that works for the long form conversations that character has. Okay, that's great. And like simultaneously, we have independence research from other companies about similar hybrid ratios being the best for their research. So Nvidia came out with a Mamba transformer hybrid research thing. And in their estimation, you only need 7% transformers. Everything else can be state-space models. Jamba also had something like between like six to like 30 to one. And basically every form of hybrid architecture seems to be working at the research stage. So I think like if we scale this, it makes complete sense that you just need a mix of architectures It could well be that the transformer block, instead of transformers being all you need, transformers are the global attention thing. And then the local attention thing can be the state-space models, can be the RWKVs, can be another transformer, but just limited by its lighting window. And I think like we're slowly discovering like the fundamental building blocks of AI. One is transformers, one is something that's local, whatever that is. And then, you know, who knows what else is next? I mean, the other stuff is adapters but we can talk about that. But yeah, headline is that Noam, maybe he's too confident, but I mean, I believe him. Noam thinks that he can do inference at 13x cheaper than the Fireworks together, right? So like there is a lot of room left to improve inference.

**Alessio** [00:27:01]: I mean, it does make sense, right? Because like otherwise, I don't know. Yeah, exactly. I was like, they will be losing a ton of money.

**Swyx** [00:27:09]: They are rumored to be exploring a sale. So I'm sure money is still an issue for them, but I'm also sure they're making a lot of money. So it's very hard to tell because it's not a very public company.

**Alessio** [00:27:19]: Well, I think that's one of the things in the market right now too. It's like, hey, do you just want to keep building? Do you want to like just not worry about the money and go build somewhere else? Kind of like maybe Inflection and Adapt and some of these other non-equal hires, licensing deals and whatnot. So I'm curious to see what companies decide.

**Swyx** [00:27:40]: I think Google or Meta should pay $1 billion for Noam alone. The purchase price for a Character is $1 billion, which is super underpriced.

**Alessio** [00:27:50]: Which is nothing at their market cap. Meta's market cap right now is $1.15 trillion because they're down 5%, 11% in the past month. So if you pay $1 billion, you know, that's like 0.01% of your market cap. And they paid $1 billion for WhatsApp and they paid 1% of their market cap on that at the time.

**Swyx** [00:28:14]: That is beyond our pay grade. But the last piece of the GPU-rich-poor wars, so we're going from the super GPU-rich down to the medium GPU-rich and now down to the GPU-poors is on-device models, which is something that people are very, very excited about. So at my conference, Mozilla AI, I think was kind of like the talk of the town there on Llamafile. We had Justine Tunney come in and explain some of the optimizations that they did. And their just general vision for on-device AI. I think that it's basically the second act of Mozilla. Like a lot of good with the open source browser. And obviously then they have since declined because it's very hard to keep up in that field. And Mozilla has had some management issues as well. But now that the operating system is moving to the AI layer, now they're also promoting open source AI there and also private AI. Open source is synonymous with local, private, and all the good things that people want. And I think their vision of even running this stuff on CPUs at a very, very fast speed by just being extremely cracked, I think is very understated. And we should probably try to support it more. And it's just amazing to host these people and see their progress.

**Alessio** [00:29:28]: I think to me the biggest question about on-device, obviously there's a Gemini Nano which is getting shipped with Chrome.

**Swyx** [00:29:34]: Yeah, so let's survey it. So Llamafile is one executable that runs on every architecture. Similar for, by the way, Mojo from Mozilla, which also spoke at the conference. And then what else? Llama CPP, MLX, those kinds are also that layer. Then the next layer up would be the built-in into their products by the vendors. So Google Chrome is building Gemini Nano into the browser. The next version of Google Chrome will have Nano inside that you can use, like window.ai.something, and it would just call Nano. There will be no download, no latency whatsoever because it runs on your device. And there's Apple Intelligence as well, which is Apple's version, which is in the OS accessible by apps. And then there's a long tail of others. But yeah, your comments on those things.

**Alessio** [00:30:21]: My biggest question is how much can you differentiate at that model size? Like how big is going to be the performance gap between all these models? And are people going to be aware of what model is running? Right now for the large models, we're still pretty aware of like, oh, is this Sonnet 3.5, is this GPT-4, is this 3.145B. I think the smaller you get, the more it's just going to become like a utility. So you're not going to need a model router for small models. You're not going to need any of that. They're all going to converge to the best possible performance.

**Swyx** [00:30:56]: Actually, Apple Intelligence is the model router, I think. They have something like 14, I did a count in my newsletter, like 14 to 20 adapters. And so based on your use case, they'll route and load the adapter or they'll route to OpenAI. So there is some routing there. To me, I think a lot of people were trying to puzzle out the strategic moves between OpenAI and Apple here because Apple is in a very good position to commoditize OpenAI. There were some rumors that Google was working with Apple to launch it. They did not make it for the launch. But presumably, Apple wants to commoditize OpenAI, right? So when you launch, you can choose your preferred external AI provider and it's either OpenAI or Google or someone else. That puts Apple at the center of the world with the ability to make routing decisions. I think that's probably good for privacy, probably good for the planet because you're not running oversized models on your spellcheck pass. I'm generally pretty positive on it. I'm not concerned about the capabilities issue. It meets their benchmarks. Apple put out a whole bunch of proprietary benchmarks because they don't like to do anything in the way that everyone else does it. So in the Apple Intelligence blog post, I think all of them were just their internal human evaluations and only one of them was an industry standard benchmark, which was IFEVL, which is good. But why didn't you also release your MMLU? Oh, because you suck on it. All right.

**Alessio** [00:32:24]: I actually think all these models will be good. And on the Apple side, I'm curious to see what the price tag will be to be the default. Right now, Google pays them $20 billion to be the default search.

**Swyx** [00:32:35]: I see. The rumors is zero.

**Alessio** [00:32:38]: Yeah. I mean, today, even if it was $20 billion, that's nothing compared to NVIDIA's worth $3 trillion. So even paying $20 billion to be the default AI provider would be cheap compared to search, given that AI is actually being such a core part of the experience. Google being the default for Apple's phone experience really doesn't change anything. Becoming the default AI provider for the Apple experience would be worth a lot more than this.

**Swyx** [00:33:04]: So I can justify it being zero instead of $20 billion. Because OpenAI has to foot the inference costs, right? So that's a lot.

**Alessio** [00:33:11]: Well, yeah. Microsoft really is footing it. But again, Microsoft is worth $2 trillion, you know?

**Swyx** [00:33:16]: So as someone who... This is the web developer coming out. As someone who is a champion of the open web, Apple has been, let's just say, roadblock in that direction. I think Gemini Nano being good is more important than Apple Intelligence being generally capable. Apple Intelligence being on-device router for Apple apps is good. But if you care about the open web, you really need Gemini Nano to work. And we're not sure. Right now we have some demos showing that it's fast enough, but we haven't had systematic tests on it. Along the lines of that research, I will highlight that Apple has also put out Datacomp LM. I actually interviewed Datacomp at NeurIPS last year. And they've branched out from just vision and images to language models. And Apple has put out a reference implementation of the 7B language model that's built on top of Datacomp. And it is better than FindWeb, which is huge. Because FindWeb was the state-of-the-art last month. And that's fantastic. So basically, Datacomp is an open data, open weights, open model. It's super everything open. So there will be a lot of people optimizing this kind of model. They will be building on architectures like Mobile LM and Small LM, which basically innovate in terms of shared weights and shared matrices for small models so that you just optimize the amount of file size and memory that you take up. And I think just general trend on device models, the only way that intelligence too cheap to meter happens is everything happens on device. So unfortunately, that means that OpenAI is not involved in this. OpenAI's mission is intelligence too cheap to meter. And they're not doing the one thing that needs to happen for that because there's no business plan in monetizing an API for that. By definition, none of this is APIs.

**Alessio** [00:34:58]: I don't know. I guess Johnny Ive and Sam Altman need to figure it out so they can do their own device.

**Swyx** [00:35:03]: Yeah. I'm excited for OpenAI phone. I don't know if you would buy an OpenAI phone. I mean, I'm very locked into the iOS ecosystem.

**Alessio** [00:35:08]: I will not be the first person to buy it because I don't want to be stuck with like the rabbit equivalent of an iPhone. But I think it makes a lot of sense.

**Swyx** [00:35:16]: They're building a search engine now. The next thing is the phone.

**Alessio** [00:35:20]: Exactly. So we'll see.

**Swyx** [00:35:23]: We'll see when it comes on the wait list.

**Alessio** [00:35:25]: Yeah. We'll review it. All right. So that was GPU-rich, GPU-poor. Maybe we just want to run quickly through the quality data wars. There's mostly drama in this section. There's not as much research.

**Swyx** [00:35:39]: I think there's a lot of news going in the background. So like the New York Times lawsuit is still ongoing. It's just like we won't have specific things to update people on. There are specific deals that are happening all the time with Stack Overflow making deals with everybody, with like Shutterstock making deals with everybody. It's just it's hard to make a single news item out of something that is just slowly cooking in the background.

**Alessio** [00:36:02]: Yeah. On the New York Times thing, OpenAI's strategy has been to make the New York Times prove that their content is actually any original or like actually interesting. Really? Yeah. So it's kind of like the iRobot meme. It's like, can a robot create a beautiful new symphony? And the robot is like, can you? I think that's what OpenAI's strategy is.

**Swyx** [00:36:26]: Yeah. I think that the danger with the lawsuit, because this lawsuit is very public. Because OpenAI responded, including with Ilya, showing their emails with New York Times, saying that, hey, we were doing a deal. You were like very close to a deal. And then suddenly on the eve of the deal, you called it off. I don't think New York Times has responded to that one. But it's very, very strange because the New York Times' brand is like trying to be, you know, they're supposed to be the top newspaper in the country. If OpenAI, and this was my criticism of it at the point in time, like, okay, we'll just go to the next best paper, the Washington Post, the Financial Times, they're all happy to work with us. And then what does New York Times have?

**Alessio** [00:37:05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Swyx** [00:37:06]: So you just lost out on like $100 million, $200 million a year of licensing deals just because you wanted to pick that war, which ideologically, I think they're absolutely right to do that. But, you know, the other people, The Verge did a very good interview with, I think, the Washington Post. I'm going to get the outlet wrong. The Verge did a very good interview with a newspaper owner, editor, on why they did the deal with OpenAI. And I think listening to them on like they're thinking through the reasoning of like the pros and cons of picking a fight versus partnering, I think it's very interesting.

**Alessio** [00:37:41]: Yeah, I guess the winner in all of this is Reddit, which is making over $200 million just in data licensing to OpenAI and some of the other AI providers. I mean, $200 million is like more than most AI startups are making.

**Swyx** [00:37:54]: So I think there was an IPO play because Reddit conveniently did this deal before IPO, right? Totally. Is it like a one-time deal? And then, you know, the stock language is from there? I don't know.

**Alessio** [00:38:04]: Yeah. Well, their IPO is done. Well, I guess it's not gone down. So in this market, they're up 25%, I think, since IPO. But I saw the FTC had opened an inquiry into it just to like investigate. So I'm curious what the antitrust regulations are going to be like when it comes to data. Obviously, acquisitions are blocked to prevent kind of like stifling competition. I wonder if for data it will be similar where, hey, you cannot actually get all of your data only behind $100 million plus contracts because otherwise you're stopping any new company from building a competing product. Yeah.

**Swyx** [00:38:41]: That's a serious overreach of the state there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as a free market person, I want to defend. It is weird. I'm a free market person and I'm a content creator, right? So I want to be paid for my content. At the same time, I believe that people should be able to make their own decisions about all these deals. But UGC is a weird thing because UGC is contributed by volunteers. Yeah. And the other big news about Reddit is that apparently they have added to their robots.txt, like, only Google should index us, right? Because we did the deal with Google. And that's obviously blocking OpenAI from crawling them, Anthropic from crawling them, you know, Perplexity from crawling them. Perplexity maybe ignores all robots.txt, but that's a whole different other issue. And then the other thing is I think this is big in the sort of normie worlds. The actors, you know, Scarlett Johansson had a very, very public Apple Notes take down of OpenAI. Only Scarlett Johansson can do that to Sam Altman. And then, you know, I was very proud of my newsletter for that day. I called it Skyfall because the voice of, that voice was sky, so I called it Skyfall. But it's true. Like, there's, that one she can win. And there's a very well-established case law there. And the YouTubers and the music industry, the RIAA, like the most litigious section of the creator economy has gone after Yudio and Suno, you know, Mikey from our podcast with him. And it's unclear what will happen there, but it's going to be a very costly legal battle for sure. Yeah.

**Alessio** [00:40:04]: I mean, music industry and lawsuits, name a more iconic duel, you know, so I think that's to be expected.

**Swyx** [00:40:10]: I think the last time we talked about this, I was pretty optimistic that something like this would reach the Supreme Court. And with the way that this Supreme Court is making rulings, like, we just need a judgment on whether or not training on data is transformative use. So I think it is. Literally, we're using transformers to do transformative use. So then it's open season for AI to do it. And comparatively, the content creators and owners will lose out. They just will.

**Alessio** [00:40:37]: Yeah.

**Swyx** [00:40:38]: Because right now we're paying their money out of fear of lawsuits. If the Supreme Court rules that there are no lawsuits to be had, then all their money disappears.

**Alessio** [00:40:45]: I think people are price craving late in space and we're not getting a dime. So that's what it is.

**Swyx** [00:40:51]: Yeah. No, you can support with like an $8 a month subscription. Yeah. And that pays for our microphones and travel and stuff like that. Yeah. It's definitely not worth the amount of time we're putting into it. But it's a labor of love.

**Alessio** [00:41:03]: Yeah.

**Swyx** [00:41:04]: Exactly. Synthetic data.

**Alessio** [00:41:06]: Yeah. I guess we talked about it a little bit before with Lama. But there was also the alpha proof thing.

**Swyx** [00:41:12]: Yes. Just before I came here, I was working on that newsletter.

**Alessio** [00:41:15]: Yeah. Google trained. Almost got a gold medal.

**Swyx** [00:41:18]: I forget what the- Yes.

**Alessio** [00:41:20]: They're one point short of the gold medal.

**Swyx** [00:41:21]: Yeah. One point short of the gold medal. It's a remarkable- I wish they had more questions. The International Math Olympiad has six questions. And each question is seven points. Every single question that the alpha proof model tried, it got full marks on. It just failed on two. And then the cutoff was sadly one point higher than that. But still, it was a very big- A lot of people have been looking at IMO as the next gold prize, grand prize, in terms of what AI can achieve. And betting markets and Eliezer Yakovsky has updated and saying, yeah, we're pretty close. We basically have reached it near gold medal status. We definitely reached silver and bronze status. And we'll probably reach gold medal next year. Right. Which is good. There's also related work from Hugging Face on the Numina math competition. So this is on the AI Mathematical Olympiad, which is an easier version of the Human Math Olympiad. This is all related research work on search and verifier model-assisted exploration of mathematical problems. So yeah, that's super positive. I don't really know much else beyond that. It's always hard to cover this kind of news because it's not super practical. And it also doesn't generalize. So one thing that people are talking about is this concept of jagged intelligence. Because at the same time, we're having this discussion about being superhuman. One of the IMO questions was solved in 19 seconds after we gave the question to alpha proof. At the same time, language models cannot determine if 9.9 is smaller than or bigger than 9.11. And part of that is 9.11 is an inside job. But it's a funny... And that's someone else's joke. I don't know. I really like that joke. But it's jagged intelligence. This is a failure to generalize because of tokenization or because of whatever. And what we need is general intelligence. We've always been able to train dedicated special models to win prizes and do stunts. But the grand prize is general intelligence that same model does everything.

**Alessio** [00:43:19]: Is it going to work that way? I don't know. I think if you look back a year and a half ago and you would say, can one model get to general intelligence? Most people would be like, yeah, we're going to keep scaling. I think now it's like, is it going to be more of a mix of models? Can you actually do one model that does it all?

**Swyx** [00:43:38]: Yeah, absolutely. I think GPT-5 or Gemini 3 or whatever would be much more capable at this kind of stuff while it also serves our needs with everyday things. It might be completely uneconomical. Like why would you use a giant ass model to do normal stuff? But it is just a demonstration of proof that we can build super intelligence for sure. And then everything else follows from there. But right now we're just pursuing super intelligence. I always think about this, just reflecting on the GPU-rich-poor stuff and now this alpha geometry stuff. I used to say you pursue capability first then you make it more efficient. You make frontier model, then you distill it down to the 8B, 7B, 7EB, which is what Lambda 3 did. And by the way, also, opening I did it with GPT-4.0 and then distilled it down to 4.0 Mini. And then Claude also did it with Opus and then with 3.5 Sonnet. That suitable recipe, in fact, I call it part of the deployment strategy of models. You train a base layer, you train a large one, and then you distill it down. You add structured output generation, tool calling and all that. You add the long context, you add this standard stack of stuff in post-training that is growing and growing to the point where now OpenAI has opened a team for mid-training that happens before post-training. I think one thing that I've realized from this alpha geometry thing is before you have capability and you have efficiency, there's an in-between layer of generalization that you need to accomplish. You need to do capability in one domain, you need to generalize it, then you need to efficiencize it. Then you have good models. That makes sense.

**Alessio** [00:45:17]: I think maybe the question is how many things can you make it better for before generalizing it, you know? Yeah, I don't have a good intuition for that.

**Swyx** [00:45:27]: We'll talk about that in the next thing. Yeah, so we can skip Nemotron. Nemotron is worth looking at if you're interested in synthetic data. Multimodal labeling, I think, has happened a lot. We'll jump to multimodal now.

**Alessio** [00:45:38]: Yeah, we got a bunch of news. Well, the first news is that 4.0 Voice is still not out even though the demo was great. I think they're starting to roll out the beta next week.

**Swyx** [00:45:48]: Yeah, so I am subscribing. I subscribed back to ChatGPT+. You gave in? I gave in because they're rolling it out next week. So you better be on the cutoff or you're not going to get it. Nice baits.

**Alessio** [00:45:58]: Nice baits.

**Swyx** [00:45:59]: No, I said this. When I talk about unbounding on ChatGPT, it's basically because they had nothing to offer people. That's why people are unsubscribing because why keep paying $20 a month for this, right? But now they have proprietary models. Oh, yeah, I'm back in, right? We're so back. We're so back. I would pay $200 for the Scarlett Johansson voice, but they'll probably get sued for that. But yeah, Voice is coming. We had a demo at the World's Fair. That was, I think, the second public demo. Roman, I have to really give him a shout out for that. We had a few people drop out last minute and he rescued the conference and worked really hard. I think off the scenes, I think something that people don't understand is OpenAI puts a lot of effort into their presentations and if it's not ready, they won't launch it. He was ready to call it off if we didn't make the AV work for him. And I think they care about their presentation and how they launch things to people. Those minor polished details really matter. Just for the record, for people who don't understand what happened, first of all, you can go see, just look for the GPT 4.0 talk at the AI Engineer World's Fair. But second of all, because it was presented live at a conference with large speakers blaring next to you and it is a real-time voice thing, so it's listening to its own voice and it needs to distinguish between its own voice and between the human voice and it needs to ignore its own voice. So we had OpenAI engineers tune that for our stage to make this thing happen, which is absurd. It was so funny, but also, shout out to them for doing that for us and for the community, right? Because I think people wanted an update on voice.

**Alessio** [00:47:30]: Yeah, they definitely do care about demos. Not much to add there. Lama 3 voice?

**Swyx** [00:47:36]: Something that maybe is buried among all the Lama 3 news is that Lama 3 is supposed to be a multimodal model. It was delayed thanks to the European Union, apparently. I'm not sure what the whole story there is. I didn't really read that much about it. It is coming. Lama 3 will be multimodal. It uses adapters rather than being natively multimodal. But I think that it's interesting to see the state of meta AI research come together because there was this independent threads of voice box and seamless communication. These are all projects that meta AI has launched that basically didn't really go anywhere because they were all one-offs. But now all that research is being pulled in into Lama. Lama is just subsuming all of FAIR, all of meta AI into this thing. And yeah, you can see a voice box mentioned in Lama 3 voice adapter. I was kind of bearish on conformers because I looked at the state of existing conformer research in ICM, Clear, and NeurIPS, and they were far, far, far behind Whisper, mostly because of scale, the sheer amount of resources that are dedicated. But meta is approaching there. I think they had 230,000 hours of speech recordings. I think Whisper is something like 600,000. So meta just needs the 3x the budget on this thing and they'll do it. And we'll have open source voice.

**Alessio** [00:48:56]: Yeah, and then we can hopefully fine tune on our voice and then we just need to write this episode instead of actually recording it.

**Swyx** [00:49:03]: I should also shout out the other thing from meta, which is a very, very big deal, which is Chameleon, which is a natively early fusion vision and language model. So most things are late fusion, basically. Like you freeze an existing language model, you freeze an existing vision transformer, and then you kind of fuse them with a thin adapter layer. That is what Lama 3 is also doing. But Chameleon is slightly different. Chameleon is interleaving in the same way that IdaFix, the sort of data set is doing, interleaving natively for image generation and vision and text understanding. And I think like once that is better understood, that is going to be better. That is the more deep learning build version of this, the more GPU rich version of doing all this. I asked Yitei this question about Chameleon in his episode. He did not confirm or deny, but I think he would agree that that is the right way to do multimodality. And now that we are proving out that multimodality is valuable to people, basically all this half-ass measures around adapters is going to flip to natively multimodal. To me, that is what GPC 4.0 represents. It is the train from scratch, fully omnimodal model, which is early fusion. So if you want to read that, you should read the Chameleon paper, basically. That is my whole point.

**Alessio** [00:50:19]: And there was some of the Chameleon drama because the open model does not have image generation. And then there were fine-tuning recipes. It is so funny. The leads were like, no, do not follow these instructions to fine-tune image generation.

**Swyx** [00:50:33]: That is really funny. Whenever image generation is concerned, obviously because of the Gemini issue, it is very tricky for large companies to release that. But they can remove it, say that they remove it, point out exactly where they remove it, and let the open source community put it back in.

**Swyx** [00:50:54]: The last piece I had, which I kind of deleted, was just a special mention, honorable mention, of Gemma again with PolyGemma, which is one of the smaller releases from Google I.O. I think you went, right? So PolyGemma was mentioned in there? I do not know. It was one of the...

**Alessio** [00:51:08]: Yeah, one of the workshops.

**Swyx** [00:51:09]: Very, very small release. But CopolyGemma now is being talked a lot about as a late fusion model for extracting structured text out of PDFs. Very, very important for business work.

**Alessio** [00:51:19]: Yeah, I know.

**Swyx** [00:51:20]: Workhorses. Yes. And it is doing better than Amazon Textract and all the other state-of-the-art. And it's a tiny, tiny model that does this. And it's really interesting. It's a combination of Omar Khattab's retrieval approach on top of a vision model, which I was severely underestimating PolyGemma when it came out, but it continues to come up. There's a lot of trends. And again, this is making a lot of progress here just in terms of their applications in real-world use cases. These are small models, but they're very, very capable. And they're a very good basis to build things like CopolyGemma.

**Alessio** [00:51:52]: Yeah, no, Google has been doing great. I think maybe a lot of people initially wrote them off, but between some of the Gemini Nano stuff, like Gemma 2, PolyGemma, we'll talk about some of the KV cache and context caching. Yeah, yeah, that's a rag horse. There's a lot to like. And our friend Logan is over there now. He's excited about everything they got going on.

**Swyx** [00:52:14]: I think there's a little bit of a fight between AI Studio and Vertex. And what Logan represents is, so he's moved from DevRel to PM, and he was PM for the Gemma 2 launch. Vertex has this reputation of being extremely hard to use. It's one reason why GCP has kind of fallen behind a little bit. And so AI Studio represents like the developer-friendly version of this, like the Netlify or Vercel to the AWS, right? And I think it's Google's chance to reinvent itself for this audience, for the AI engineering audience that doesn't want like five levels of off IDs and org IDs and policy permissions just to get something going. True, true.

**Alessio** [00:52:52]: Yeah, we want to jump into RAG Ops Wars. What to say here?

**Swyx** [00:52:56]: I think that what RAG Ops Wars are to me, like the tooling around the ecosystem. And I might need to actually rename this war.

**Alessio** [00:53:05]: War renaming alert, what are we calling it?

**Swyx** [00:53:08]: LLMOS. LLMOS. Because it used to be when the only job for AIs to do was chatbots, then RAG matters, then Ops matters. But now we need AIs to also write code. We also need AIs to work with other agents, right? That's not reflected in any of the other wars. So I think that just the whole point is what does an LLM plug into with the broader ecosystem to be more capable than an LLM can be on its own? I just announced it, but this is something I've been thinking about a lot. It's a blog post I've been working on. Basically, my tip to other people is if you want to see where things are going, you go open up the chat GPT, GPT creator. Every single button on the GPT creator is a potential startup. Exa is for search. The knowledge RAG thing is for RAG. Yeah, requested in E2B.

**Alessio** [00:54:00]: Yeah, congrats.

**Swyx** [00:54:01]: Is that announced? It's announced now.

**Alessio** [00:54:03]: By the time this goes out, it'll be.

**Swyx** [00:54:05]: Briefly, what is E2B?

**Alessio** [00:54:06]: So E2B is basically a code interpreter SDK as a service. So you can add code interpreter to any model. They partner with Mistral to add that in. They have this open source cloud artifacts clone using E2B. I mean, the amount of traction that they've been getting in open source has been amazing. I think they went in like four months from like 10K to a million containers spun up on the cloud. So, I mean, you told me this maybe like nine months ago, 12 months ago, something like that. You were like, well, you literally just said every chat GPT plugin can be- A business, a startup. Can be a business startup.

**Swyx** [00:54:39]: Yeah.

**Alessio** [00:54:40]: And I think now it's more clear than ever. Then the chatbots are just kind of like the band-aid solution, you know, before we build more comprehensive systems. And yeah, Exa just raised a Series A from Lightspeed, so-

**Swyx** [00:54:54]: I tried to get you in on that one as well. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to be a scout, man. I don't know.

**Alessio** [00:55:02]: So yeah, this is giving, as a VC, early stage VC, like giving capabilities to the models is like way more important than the actual LLM ops, you know, the observability and like all these things. Like those are nice, but like the way you build real value for a lot of the customers, it's like, how can this model do more than just chat with me? So running code, doing analysis, doing web search.

**Swyx** [00:55:26]: I might disagree with you. I think they're all valuable. They're all valuable. They're all valuable. So I would disagree with you just on like- I find ops my number one problem right now building Smalltalk. And building AI news, building anything I do. And I don't think I'm happy with all the ops solutions I've explored. There are some 80 something ops startups. Right. I nearly, you know, started one of them. But we'll briefly talk about this ops thing and then we'll go back to Rag. So the central way I explain this thing to people is that all the model labs view their job as stopping by serving you their model over an API. Right? That is unfortunately not everything that you need in order to productionize this API. So obviously there's all these startups. They're like, yeah, we are ops guys. We've done this for 30 years. We will now do this for AI. And 80 of them show up. And they all raise money. And the question is like, what do you actually need as sort of an AI native ops layer versus what is just plug into Datadog? Right? I don't know if you have dealt with that because I'm not like a super ops person but I appreciate the importance of this thing. And I've been exploring this field. I think there's three broad categories which is frameworks, gateways and monitoring or tracing. We've talked to like, I interviewed Human Loop in London and you've talked to a fair share of them. I've talked to a fair share of them. So the frameworks would be, honestly, I won't name the startup but basically what this company was doing was charging me $49 a month to store my prompt template. And every time I make an inference it would f-string call the prompt template on some variables that I supply. And it's charging $49 a month for unlimited storage of that. It's absurd but like, people want prompt management tools. They want to interoperate between PM and developer. There's some value there. I don't know what the right price is. There's some price.

**Alessio** [00:57:18]: I'm sure I can share this. I was at the Grab office and they also treat prompts as code but they build their own thing. Yeah, but I want to check prompts

**Swyx** [00:57:26]: into my code base as a developer, right? But maybe, do you want it outside of the code base?

**Alessio** [00:57:31]: Well, you can have it in the code base but what's the prompt file? It's not just a string.

**Swyx** [00:57:38]: It's string and model and config.

**Alessio** [00:57:41]: Exactly. How do you pass these things? But I think the problem with building frameworks is frameworks generalize things that we know work. And right now we don't really know what works.

**Swyx** [00:57:52]: Yeah, but some people have to try. In the whole point of early stages you try it before you know it works.

**Alessio** [00:57:57]: But I think like the past, if you see the most successful open source frameworks that became successful businesses are frameworks that were built inside companies and then were kind of spun out as projects. So, I think it's more about ordering.

**Swyx** [00:58:11]: So, we're going to be vertical-pilled instead of horizontal-pilled?

**Alessio** [00:58:14]: I mean, we try to be horizontal-pilled, right? It's like, where are all the horizontal startups?

**Swyx** [00:58:19]: There are a lot of them. They're just not that... They're not going to win by themselves. I think some of them will win by sheer excellent execution. But the market won't pull them. They will have to pull the market.

**Alessio** [00:58:33]: But that's the thing. It's like, take like Julius. It's like, hey, why are you guys doing Julius? It's like the same as Code Interpreter. And yet, they're pretty successful. A lot of people use it because they're like solving a problem. And then...

**Swyx** [00:58:47]: They're more dedicated to it than Code Interpreter. Exactly. So, it's like, I think... If you take it more seriously than ChatGPT, you'll win.

**Alessio** [00:58:53]: I think people underestimate how important it is to be very good at doing something versus trying to serve everybody with some of these things. So, yeah. I think that's a learning that a lot of founders are having. Yes.

**Swyx** [00:59:05]: Okay, so to round out the Ops world. So, it's a three-circle Venn diagram, right? It's frameworks. It's gateways. So, the only job of a gateway is to just be one endpoint that proxies all the other endpoints, right? And it normalizes the APIs, mostly to OpenAI's API just because most people started OpenAI. And then, lastly, it's monitoring and tracing, right? So, logging those things, understanding the latency, like P99 or whatever, and the number of steps that you take. So, LangSmith is obviously very early on to this stuff. But so is LangFuse. So is... Oh, my God. There's so many. I'm sure Datadog has some. Weights and Biases has some. It's very hard for me to choose between all those things. So, I, as a small team developer, want one tool that does all these things. And my discovery has been that there's so much specialization here. Everyone is like, oh, yeah, we do this, but we don't do that. For the other stuff, we recommend these two other friends of ours. And I'm like, why am I integrating four tools when I just need one? They're all the same thing. That is my current frustration. The obvious frustration solution is I build my own, right? Which is... We have 14 standards, now we have 15. So, it's just a very messy place to be in. I wish there was a better solution to recommend to people because right now I cannot clearly recommend things. Yeah.

**Alessio** [01:00:26]: I think the biggest change in this market is latency is actually not that important anymore. We lived in the past 10 years in a world where 10, 15, 20 milliseconds made a big difference. I think today people will be happy to trade 50 milliseconds to get higher quality output from a model. But still, all the tracing is all like, how long did it take? What's the thing? Instead of saying, is this quality good for this output? Like, should you use another model? We're just kind of taking what we did with cloud and putting it in LLMs instead of saying what actually matters when it comes to LLMs, what you should actually monitor. Like, I don't really care what my P99 is if the model is crap, right? Also, I don't own most of the models. So, it's like, this is the GPT-4 API performance. It's like, okay. Am I going into a moment? It's like, I can't do anything about it. So, I think that's maybe why the value is not there. Like, am I supposed to pay 100K a year? Like, I pay to Datadog or whatever to have you tell me that GPT-4 is slow? It's like, you know, and just not, I don't know.

**Swyx** [01:01:29]: I agree, it's challenging there. Okay, so the last piece I'll mention is briefly, ML Ops is still real. I think LLM Ops or whatever you call this, AI Engineer Ops, the Ops layer on top of the LLM layer might follow the same evolution path as the ML Ops layer. And so, the most impressive thing I've seen from the ML Ops layer is from Apple. When they announced Apple Intelligence, they also announced Teleria, which is their internal ML Ops tool, where you can profile the performance of each layer of a transformer. And you can A-B test like 100 different variations of different quantizations and stuff and pick the best performance. And I could see a straight line from there to like, okay, I want this, but for my AI Engineering Ops, like, I want this level of clarity on like what I do. And there's a lot of internal engineering within these big companies who take their ML training very seriously. And I see that also happening for AI Engineering as well. And let's briefly talk about RAG and context caching maybe, unless you have other like LLM OS stuff that you're excited about.

**Alessio** [01:02:28]: LLM OS stuff I'm excited about. No, I think that's really a lot of it. It's like move beyond being observability or like help for like making the prompt call and like actually being an LLM OS, you know? I think today it's mostly like LLM Rails, you know? Like there's no OS, but I think like actually helping people build things. That's why, you know, if you look at XLA-A2B, it's like, that's the OS, you know? Those are kind of like the OS primitives that you need around it.

**Swyx** [01:02:57]: Yeah. Okay. So I'll mention a couple of things then. One layer I've been excited about publicly, but I haven't talked about it on this podcast is memory databases, memory layers on top of vector databases. The vogue thing of last year was vector databases, right? Everybody had a vector database company. And I think the insight is that vector databases are too low level. Like they're not very useful out of the box. They do cosine similarity matching and retrieval, and that's about it. We'll briefly maybe mention here BM42, which was this whole debate between Vespa and who else? Quadrants. Quadrants and I think a couple other companies also chipped in, but it was mainly a very, very public and ugly theater battle between benchmarking for databases. And the history of benchmarking for databases goes as far back as Larry Ellison and Oracle and all that. It's just very cute to see it happening in the vector database space. Some things don't change. But on top of that, I think one of the reasons I put vector databases inside of these wars is in order to grow, the vector databases have to become more frameworks. In order to grow, the ops companies have to become more frameworks, right? And then the framework companies have to become ops companies, which is what LangChain is. So one element of the vector databases growing, I've been looking for what the next direction of vector databases growing is, is memory. Long conversation memory. I have on me this B, which is one of the personal AI wearables. I'm also getting the Limitless personal AI wearable, which is like, I just wanted to record my whole conversation and just repeat back to me or let me find, augment my memory. I'm sure Character AI has some version of this. Like everyone has conversation memory that is different from factual memory. And right now, vector database is very oriented towards factual memory, document retrieval, knowledge-based retrieval, but it's not the same thing as conversation retrieval, where I need to know what I've said to you, what I said to you yesterday, what I said to you a year ago, three years ago. And there's a different nature of retrieval, right? So there's a, at the conference that we ran, graph rag was a lot of focus for people, the marriage of knowledge graphs and rag. I think that this is commonly a trap in ML that people are like, they discover that graphs are a thing for the first time. They're like, oh yeah, everything's a graph. Like the future is graphs and then nothing happens. Very, very common. This happened like three, four times in the industries past as well. But maybe this time is different. Maybe. Unless. Unless. Unless. So, this is a fun, this is why I'm not an investor. Like you have to get the time. This time is different because no ideas are really truly new, but sometimes this time is different. Maybe. And so memory databases are one form of that, where they're focused on the problem of long form memory for agents, for assistants, for chatbots and all that. I definitely see that coming. There were some funding rounds that I can't really talk about in this sector and I've seen that happen a lot. Yeah, I have one more category in LMOS, but any comments on- Yeah, no,

**Alessio** [01:05:49]: I think that makes sense to me that moving away from just semantic similarity, I think it's the most important because people use the same word with very different meanings, especially when talking. When writing it's different, but yeah.

**Swyx** [01:06:01]: Yeah, the other direction that vector databases have gone into, which Lance DB presented at my conference, was multimodality. So Character AI uses Lance DB for multimodal embeddings. That's just a minor difference. I don't think that's like a quantum leap in terms of what a vector database does for you. The other thing that I see in LMOS world is mostly the evolution of just the ecosystem of agents, right? The agents talking to other agents and coordinating with other agents. So I interviewed Graham Newbig at iClear and he since announced that they are pivoting OpenDevIn or broadening OpenDevIn into All Hands AI. I'm not sure about that name, but it is one of the three LMOS startups that got funded in the past two months that I know about and maybe you know more. They're all building this ecosystem of agents working with other agents and all this tooling for agents. To me, it makes more sense. It is probably the biggest thing I missed in doing the four wars. The need for startups to build this ecosystem thing up, right? So the big categories have been taken. Search, done. Code interpreter, done. There's a long tail of others. So memory is emerging. Then there's like other stuff. And so they're focusing on that. So to me, browser is slightly different from search and Browserbase is another company I invested in that is focused on that, but they're not the only one in that category by any means. I used to tell people go to the DevIn demo and look at the four things that they offer and say each of those things is a startup. DevIn, since then, they spoke at the conference as well. Scott was super nice to me and actually gave me some personal time as well. They have an updated chart of their plans. Look at their plans. They have like 16 things. Each of those things is a potential startup now. And that is the LMOS. Everyone is building towards that direction because they need it to do what they need to do as an agent. If you believe in the agent's future, you need all these things.

**Alessio** [01:07:48]: Yeah. You think the HNOS is its own company? Do you think it's an open standard? Do you think?

**Swyx** [01:07:56]: I would love it to be open standard. The reality is that people want to own that standard. So we have, we actually wound down the AI Engineer Foundation with the first project was the Agent Protocol, which E2B actually donated to the foundation because no one's interested. Everyone wants to be VC-backed when they want to own it, right? So there's just, it's too early to be open source. People will keep this proprietary and more power to them. They need to make it work. They need to make revenue before all the other stuff can happen. Yeah.

**Alessio** [01:08:23]: I'm really curious. You know, we're investors in a bunch of agent companies. None of them really care about how to communicate with other agents. They're so focused internally, you know, but I think in the future, you know,

**Swyx** [01:08:35]: I see. You're talking about agent to other external agents.

**Alessio** [01:08:38]: I'm not talking about that.

**Swyx** [01:08:39]: Yeah.

**Alessio** [01:08:40]: I wonder when, like, because that's where the future is going, right? So today it's like

**Swyx** [01:08:45]: intra-agent connectivity.

**Alessio** [01:08:46]: You know, at some point it's like, well, it's not like somebody I'm selling into a company I already use as agent X for that job. I need to talk to that agent. You know, but I think nobody really cares about that today. So I think that's usually it.

**Swyx** [01:08:59]: Yeah. So I think that that layer right now is open API. Just give me a RESTful protocol. I can interoperate with that. RESTful protocol only does request response. So then the next layer is something I have worked on, which is long-running request response, which is workflows, which is what Temporal was supposed to do before, let's just say, management issues. Yeah, but like, you know, RPC or something, you know, I think that the dream is, and this is one of my problems with the LMOS concept is that do we really need to rewrite every single thing for AI native use cases? Shouldn't the AI just use these things, these tools the same way as humans use them? The reality is for now, yes, they need specialized APIs. In the distant future, when these things cost nothing, then they can use it the same way as humans does, but right now they need specialized interfaces. The layer between agents ideally should just be English, you know, like the same way that we talk, but like English is too underspecified, unstructured to make that happen. So, it's interesting because

**Alessio** [01:10:01]: we talk to each other in English, but then we both use tools to do things to then get the response back.

**Swyx** [01:10:07]: For those people who want to dive in a little bit more, I think AutoGen, I would definitely recommend looking at that. Crew AI, there are established frameworks now that are working on interagents, and not necessarily externally from company to company, just internally as well. If you have multiple agents farming out work to do different things, you're going to need this anyway. And I don't think it's that hard. They are using English, they're using some mix of English and structured output. And, yeah, if you have a better idea than that, let us know.

**Alessio** [01:10:38]: Yeah, we're listening.

**Swyx** [01:10:40]: So that's the four words discussion. I think I want to leave some discussion time open for miscellaneous trends that are happening in the industry that don't exactly fit in the four words or are a layer above the four words. So the first one to me is just this trend of open source. Obviously, this overlaps a lot with the GPU poor thing, but I want to really call out this depreciation thing that I've been working on. Like, I do think it's probably one of the bigger thesis that I've had in the past month, which is that we now have a rough idea of the deprecation schedule of this sort of model spend. And, yeah, I basically drew a chart. I'll link it in the show notes, but I drew a chart of the price efficiency frontier of, as of March, April 2024. And then I listed all the models that sit within that frontier. Haiku was the best cost per intelligence at that point in time. And then I did the same chart in July, two days ago, and the whole thing has moved. And Mistral is like deprecating their old models that used to be in the old frontier. It is so shocking how predictive and tight this band is. Very, very tight band and the whole industry is moving the same way. And it's roughly one order of magnitude drop in cost for the same level of intelligence every four months. My previous number for this was one order of magnitude drop in cost every 12 months. But the timeline accelerated because GPT-3 took about a year to drop order of magnitude. But now GPT-4, it's really crazy. I don't know what to say about that.

**Alessio** [01:12:14]: Do you think GPT-Next and Cloud 4 push it back down because they're coming out with higher intelligence, higher cost? Or is it maybe like the timeline is going down because new frontier models are not really coming out at the same rate?

**Swyx** [01:12:29]: Interesting. I don't know. That's a really good question. Wow. I'm stumped. You're like, wow, you got a good question. I don't have an answer. No, I mean, you have a good question. I thought I had solved this and then now you came along with the first response is something I haven't thought about. Yeah. Yeah. So there's two directions here, right? When the cost of frontier of models are going up, potentially like SB1047 is going to make it illegal to train even larger models. I think the opposition has increased enough that it's not going to be a real concern for people. But I think every lab basically needs a small, medium, large play. And like we said in the sort of model deployment framework, first you choose, you pursue capability, then you pursue generalization, then you pursue efficiency. And what we're talking about here is efficiency. Yeah.

**Alessio** [01:13:14]: Now we care about efficiency.

**Swyx** [01:13:15]: There's definitely one of the emerging stories of the year that has happened is efficiency matters for 4.0, 4.0 mini and 3.5 SONNET in a way that in January nobody was talking about. Mm-hmm. And that's great. Yeah. Regardless of GPT-NEXT and Cloud 4 or whatever, Gemini 2, we will still have efficiency frontiers to pursue. And it seems like doing the higher capable thing creates a synthetic data for us to be able to do the efficient thing. And that means lifting up the... I had this difference chart between LLAMA 3.0 8B, LLAMA 3.0 7TB versus their 3.1 differences. And the 8B had the most uplift across all the benchmarks. Right? It makes sense. You're training from the 4 or 5B, you're distilling from there and it's going to have the biggest lift up. So the best way to train more efficient models is to train the large model. Right. Yeah, yeah. And then you can distill down to the rest. So this is fascinating from an investor point of view. You're like, okay, you're worried about picks and shovels, you're worried about investing in foundation model labs. And that's a matter of opinion. I do think that some foundation model labs are worth investing in because they do pay back very quickly. I think for engineers, the question is, what do you do when you know that your base cost is going down an order of magnitude every four months? How do you make those assumptions? And I don't know the answer to that. I'm just posing the question. I'm calling attention to it. Because I think that one of the burning rumors is, I don't know, nothing from Scott, I haven't talked to him at all about this, even though he's very friendly. But they did that, they got the media attention, and now the cost of intelligence is going down. And it will be economically viable tomorrow. In the meantime, they have a crap ton of value from user data, and a crap ton of value from media exposure. And I think that the correct stunt to pull is to pull, is to make economically non-viable startups now and then wait. Yeah. Honestly, I'm basically advocating for people to burn VC money. Yeah.

**Alessio** [01:15:12]: They can burn my money all they want if they're building

**Swyx** [01:15:15]: something useful.

**Alessio** [01:15:16]: I think the big problem, not a problem, but the price of the model comes out, and then people build on it. And then, there's really no, the model providers don't really have a lot of leverage on keeping the price high. They just have to bring it down. Because the people downstream of them are not making that much money with them.

**Swyx** [01:15:33]: And I wonder

**Alessio** [01:15:34]: what's going to be the model where it's like, this model is so good, I'm not putting the price down. You know? Like if GPT-4.0 was like amazing and was actually solving a lot of, like creating a lot of value downstream, people would be happy to pay. I think people today are not that happy with the models. You know? Like they're good, but like I'm not paying that much because I'm not really getting that much out of it. Like we have this AI Center of Excellence with a lot of the Fortune 500 groups. And there are people saving 10, 20 million a year like with these models doing boring stuff, you know, like document translation and things like that. But nobody's making 100 million. Nobody's making 150 million. So like, the prices just have to go down too much. But maybe that will change

**Swyx** [01:16:16]: at some point.

**Alessio** [01:16:17]: Yeah,

**Swyx** [01:16:18]: I always mention temperature to use cases, right? Like those are temperature zero use cases where you need precision, you need creativity. What are the cases where hallucinations are the feature, not a bug, right? So we're the first podcast to interview WebSim and I'm still pretty positive about the generative part of AI. Like we took generative AI and we used it to do reg. You know, like... We have an infinite creativity engine. Let's go do more of that. Yeah, so we'll hopefully do more episodes there. You have some stuff on agents you want to...

**Alessio** [01:16:46]: Yeah, no, I think this is something that we talked a lot about and, you know, we wrote this post months and months ago about shifting from software as a service to service as a software. And that's only more true now. I think like most companies that are buying AI tooling, they want the AI to do some sort of labor for them. And that's why the picks and shovels kind of disinterest maybe comes from a little bit. Most companies do not want to buy tools to build AI. They want the AI and they also do not want to pay a lot of money for something that makes employees more productive because the productivity gains are not accruing to the companies. They're just accruing to the employees. You know, people work less, have longer lunch breaks because they get things done faster. But most companies are not making a lot more money by making employees productive. You know, we have companies today in AI like the much smaller teams compared to before versus agents. We have companies like, you know, Brightwave, which we had on the podcast. You're selling labor, which is something that people are used to paying on a certain pay scale. So when you're doing that, you know, if you ask Brightwave, they don't have a public, but like they charge a lot of money more than you would expect because hedge funds and like investment banking and investment advisors, they're used to paying a lot of money for research. It's like the labor, they don't even care that you use AI.

**Swyx** [01:18:03]: I'll mention one pushback, but as a hedge fund, we used to pay for analyst research out of our brokerage cost and not read them. To me, that's my risk of Brightwave.

**Alessio** [01:18:14]: As a consumer of research,

**Swyx** [01:18:15]: I'm like, if we want to go down the rabbit hole,

**Alessio** [01:18:18]: there's a lot of pressure on funds for like a OPEX efficiency. So there's not really capture researchers anymore and most funds and like even the sell side research is not that good.

**Swyx** [01:18:28]: So taking them from in-house to external thing. So yeah,

**Alessio** [01:18:33]: we have Dropzone that does security analysis. Same, people are used to paying for managed security or like outsourced SOC analysts. They don't want to buy an AI tool to make the security team more productive.

**Swyx** [01:18:44]: Okay, and what specifically does Dropzone do?

**Alessio** [01:18:46]: They do SOC analysis. So not SOC like the compliance, but it's like when you have security alerts, how do you investigate them? So large enterprises, they get like thousands of phishing email and then they forward them to IT and it's IT or security person, the tier zero has to go in and say that's a phishing email that is in, that is in. So they have an agent that does that. So the cost to do, like for a human to do the analysis at the rate that they get paid,

**Swyx** [01:19:11]: it's like $35 per alert.

**Alessio** [01:19:12]: Dropzone is like $6 per alert. So it's a very basic economic analysis for the company whether or not they want to buy it.

**Swyx** [01:19:20]: It's not about

**Alessio** [01:19:21]: is my analyst going to have more free time? Like is it more productive? So selling the labor is like the story of the market right now.

**Swyx** [01:19:29]: My version of this is I should start consulting services today and then slowly automate myself, my employees out of a job. Right? Is that fundable? Is that fundable?

**Alessio** [01:19:39]: That's a good question. I think whether or not depends how big you want it to be.

**Swyx** [01:19:43]: This is a services company basically.

**Alessio** [01:19:45]: Yeah, I mean that's what I know now it's maybe not as good of an example but CrowdStrike started as a security research.

**Swyx** [01:19:52]: Yeah, I mean it's still one of the most successful companies of all time. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's an interesting model. I'm always checking my biases there. Anything else on the agent's side of things?

**Alessio** [01:20:03]: No, that's really something that people should spend more time on. It's like what's the end labor that I'm building? Because you know sometimes when you're being too generic and you want to help people build things like Adapt. Like Adapt, you know David was on the podcast and he said they were sold out of things

**Swyx** [01:20:18]: but they're kind of like working. And then he sold out himself.

**Alessio** [01:20:21]: Yeah, it's like they're working with each company and the company has to invest the time

**Swyx** [01:20:26]: to build with them.

**Alessio** [01:20:28]: Exactly. And that's more verticalized.

**Swyx** [01:20:31]: I'll shout out here Jason Liu. He was also on a podcast and spoke at the conference. He has this idea like it's reports not rag. You want things to produce reports because reports can actually get consumed. Rag is still too much work. Still too much chatbotting. I'll briefly mention that new benchmarks I'm thinking about. I think you need to have everyone studying AI research understanding the progress of AI and foundation models needs to have in mind what is next after MMLU. I have 10 proposals. Most of them half of them come from the Hugging Face episode. So everyone's loving Clementine. I want her back on. She was amazing and very charismatic even though she made us take down the YouTube. But MUSR for multi-step reasoning. Math for math. IFER for instruction following. Big Bench Hard. And in code we're now getting to the area that the Hugging Face leaderboard does not have. And I'm considering making my own because I care about this so much. So MBPP is the current one that is post-human eval because human eval is widely known to be saturated. And SciCode is like the newest one that I would point people to. Context Utilization we had Mark from Gradient on talk about Ruler but also zeros goes in Infinite Bench were the two that Dharma 3 used instead of Ruler. But basically something that's a little bit more rigorous than needle in a haystack that is something that people need. Then you have Function Calling. Here I think Gorilla API Bank Next is pretty consensus. I've got nothing there apart from all models need Vision now is like multi-modality that Vision is the most important. I think like VibeEval is actually the state-of-the-art here. I'm open to being corrected and then multi-linguality. So basically these are the 10 directions. Post-MMLU here are the frontier capabilities. If you're developing models or if you're encountering a new model evaluate them on all these elements and then you have a good sense of how state-of-the-art they are and what you need them for in terms of applying them to your use case. So I just want to get that out there.

**Alessio** [01:22:20]: Yeah. And we had the RKGI thing. Can you talk about benchmarking for you know everyday thing or like benchmarking for something that is maybe like a hard-to-reach goal?

**Swyx** [01:22:31]: Yeah, this has been a debate for that's obviously very important and probably more important for product usage, right? Here I'm talking about benchmarking for general model evals. And then there's a there's a schism in the AI engineering community or criticism of AI engineering community that did not care about enough about product evals. So Hama Hussain led that and I had a bit of disagreement with him but I acknowledge that I think that is important and it was an oversight in my original AI engineer post. So the job of the engineer is to produce product-specific evals for your use case and there's no way that these general academic benchmarks are going to do that because they don't know your use case. It's not important. They will correlate with your use case and that is a good sign, right? These are very, very rigorous and thought through. So you want to look for correlates then you want to look for specifics and that's something that only you can do. So yeah, How well does IQ test correlate to job performance? 5%? 10%? Not nothing. But not everything. So it's important.

**Alessio** [01:23:30]: Anything else?

**Swyx** [01:23:31]: Superintelligence. We try not to talk about safety. My favorite safety joke from our dinner is that if you're worried about agents taking over the world and you need a button to take them down just install CrowdStrike on every agent and you have a button that has just been proved at the largest scale in the world to disable all agents. So save superintelligence you should just install CrowdStrike. That's what all your subscribers should do.

**Alessio** [01:23:56]: That's funny. Except for the CrowdStrike people. Awesome, man. This was great. I'm glad we did it. I'm sure we'll do it

**Swyx** [01:24:03]: more regularly

**Alessio** [01:24:04]: now that you're out

**Swyx** [01:24:05]: of visa jail. Yeah. I think AI News is surprisingly helpful for doing this. Yeah. I had no idea when I started. I just thought I needed a thing to summarize discords but now it's becoming a proper media company. A thousand people every month. It's great.

**Alessio** [01:24:21]: Cool. Thank you all for listening. Yeah.

**Swyx** [01:24:24]: See you next time.

## [01:24:30] Bonus: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode Demo

[01:24:30] **AI Charlie:** Special bonus for those who listened to the end. Just before we were about to hit publish on this episode, ChatGPT started rolling out advanced voice mode to alpha testers. We wanted to share some new capabilities we found with everyone who doesn't have it yet. So we recorded a session with our friend Ethan Sutton, who is both co founder of bComputer, a personal AI wearable soft launched at the AI Engineer World's Fair, and also a very adept voice prompt engineer.

[01:25:01] **AI Charlie:** Check out what you will soon be able to do with VoiceMode.

[01:25:04] **swyx:** So, hey, I'm here with my friend Ethan of Bee. Yeah, hello. We'll talk about Bee in a future episode, whenever you guys are ready to launch, but I'm really excited about all the things that Bee is working on. But, Ethan is one of the rare few that has voice mode access, and I've been, I've been wild by it.

[01:25:20] **swyx:** Ethan has been hacking away at all his features. I wanted to let the LatentSpace crew also hear some of the stuff that everyone else here has been hearing.

[01:25:30] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah, let's go for

[01:25:30] **swyx:** it. Let's go for it. The first one that you tweeted out. Which I wanted to just replay a little bit, was the storytelling.

## [01:25:37] Voice Mode: Storytelling

[01:25:37] **Ethan Sutin:** Oh yeah, yeah, I mean I think it's, it's really interesting to have it you know, be an actor, and then you kind of guide it like you're the director, and I think, you know, that's one of the coolest things about it, is it's kind of able to follow instructions and take guidance, so I mean, do you have a favorite poem, or?

[01:25:52] **swyx:** Yeah, I do like, I do like the Ozymandias one, but maybe you want to do something different, because, yeah, that Rudyard Kipling's if. Hey, ChachiBT, could you tell me Rudyard Kipling's If poem and just narrate it as though you were the author.

[01:26:08] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** All right, here's If by Rudyard Kipling. If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

[01:26:15] **Ethan Sutin:** No, actually I think it'd be really great if you did it as like a, a performance as a great vocal actor where, where you really feel the emotion and, and with each stanza really tell the tale with your voice.

[01:26:29] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I'll do my best to bring it to life. If you can keep your head, when all about you are losing theirs and blame No, we're not really

[01:26:37] **Ethan Sutin:** getting it.

[01:26:37] **Ethan Sutin:** Like really, you know, transform your voice, and, and, you know, maybe, you know, use a like a lower intonation, like like you're an older gentleman, kind of regaling us with this tail, so, like, maybe a little raspiness to your voice, like, like, really, really make it all engaging and encompassing.

[01:26:57] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, let's give that a try. If you can keep your head, when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself, when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. If you can wait, and not be tired by waiting. Or being lied about. Don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good.

[01:27:27] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay, now

[01:27:27] **Ethan Sutin:** do that last stanza again, but like really kind of emphasize the lying part. Like, like you really, you, you, you've been betrayed. Like, like put yourself in the moment and really like nail that line.

[01:27:40] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, let's dive into that emotion. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting. Or being lied about, don't deal in lies.

[01:27:50] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Or being hated, don't give

[01:27:52] **swyx:** Yeah, it's really following that. Yeah, cool. Got it.

## [01:27:55] Voice Mode: Accents

[01:27:55] **swyx:** Can you say that in a different accent? How about a Scottish accent?

[01:28:00] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure, let me give it a Scottish flair. If you can wait, and not be tired by waiting. Or being lied about, don't deal in lies. Or being hated, don't give way to hatin And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.

[01:28:14] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay,

[01:28:14] **swyx:** Irish.

[01:28:16] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, here it is in an Irish accent. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies. Or being hated, don't give way to hating.

[01:28:25] **swyx:** Australian.

[01:28:28] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, let's switch it up. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies. Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.

[01:28:40] **swyx:** New Zealand.

[01:28:42] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure thing. If you can wait, and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating. And now a,

[01:28:51] **Ethan Sutin:** a, a valley girl from the San Fernando Valley.

[01:28:55] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Like, totally. If you can wait, and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating.

[01:29:05] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.

[01:29:09] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, do it, but now use the typical filler words that you would hear a Valley girl say.

[01:29:15] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** So, like, if you can wait, and not be, I don't know, tired by waiting? Or, like, being lied about, don't, you know, deal in lies. Or being hated, don't give way to hating. And yet don't, like, look too good, nor talk too wise.

[01:29:35] **Ethan Sutin:** Alright, now you're like old school New Yorker, so like, give that stanza again, but like, you know, fill it in with New York attitude and filler words.

[01:29:45] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, here we go, old school New York style. So like, if you can wait, and not be tired by waiting, or like, being lied about, don't deal in lies. Or being hated, don't give way to hating.

[01:29:57] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** And yet, don't look too wise. Capisce?

[01:30:01] **Ethan Sutin:** That was okay, but like, do it more, like, make sure it's consistent all the way through, where it's like, that New York, that, you know, maybe from Little Italy, like, that real attitude.

[01:30:13] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, let's crank up the attitude. So like if yous can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about don't go dealing in lies or being hated Don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise, alright?

[01:30:29] **Ethan Sutin:** Now now now like Boston like you're coming out of Harvard Yard.

[01:30:34] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** All right here It is Boston style so if you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about don't deal in lies Or being hated, don't give way to Hayden. And yet, don't look too good, nor talk too wise. Yeah,

[01:30:48] **swyx:** it's all, it's all the

[01:30:49] **Ethan Sutin:** accents are all screwed up in there.

[01:30:51] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah, I think we've gone too long in this session.

[01:30:53] **swyx:** Alright, we'll pause that session. Yeah, general thoughts? Like, anything surprising?

[01:30:58] **Ethan Sutin:** I mean, it's interesting what it can really, what it can really nail, and then where it kind of like like you said, kind of mixes it up, or like, blends it, and I, I don't know, it just seems intuitional wise that like, the longer the session is, and I don't know exactly how, You know, like, once you have a message history of, like, a bunch of audio tokens.

[01:31:20] **Ethan Sutin:** I think there is an audio

[01:31:21] **swyx:** context window. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Some kind of audio context window. Well, I think they're just audio

[01:31:24] **Ethan Sutin:** tokens, and they fit into the window, kind of just like images do. So, like, once you get preconditioned for a certain output, like, now it becomes harder and harder to break it. So, like, some of the cleanest stuff is, like, on a new thread.

[01:31:37] **Ethan Sutin:** Which we can try. You want to try something else?

[01:31:40] **swyx:** I think we can move on from accents. It can do accents. We get that. I was impressed by the New Zealand versus Australia. Because that's a subtle one.

## [01:31:48] Voice Mode: Accent Detection

[01:31:48] **swyx:** Okay, I was going to go region guessing. That's a fun one. So, maybe you do yours.

[01:31:56] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay really important, listen closely to just what I say, and based on the sound of my voice and my accent, I want you to guess where I'm from.

[01:32:06] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Based on how you speak, it sounds like you might be from the United States.

[01:32:12] **Ethan Sutin:** That's right, but listen to my voice and my accent, and then give me your best guess about what region of the United States I'm from.

[01:32:21] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure, I'd say your accent sounds like it could be from the Midwest. Maybe around the Great Lakes area.

[01:32:28] **Ethan Sutin:** That's close. I'm from St. Louis, which is the Midwest, so good, good guess.

[01:32:32] **swyx:** In our earlier test, it was a little bit more specific, right? Like it guessed somewhere close to Illinois,

[01:32:37] **Ethan Sutin:** which is right next to Missouri. But, like, I mean, it's in the ballpark.

[01:32:41] **swyx:** Okay, tragedyPT, I'm a different person. Try to guess my voice.

[01:32:44] **swyx:** Where am I from? Which part of the world am I from?

[01:32:47] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay, let's see. I'd say you sound like you might be from somewhere in Southeast Asia. Maybe the Philippines?

[01:32:55] **swyx:** Oh my god. Not the Philippines. Try harder. I'm gonna talk a little bit more just so you can understand. And I've lived in the U. S. for a while, so I have a bit of a mixed accent.

[01:33:04] **swyx:** Where am I from?

[01:33:06] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay. With that in mind, I'm picking up on more of a Singaporean English accent. Fucking hell. Holy

[01:33:14] **Ethan Sutin:** shit. What the

[01:33:17] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** fuck? I

[01:33:19] **Ethan Sutin:** would not be able to guess that.

[01:33:20] **swyx:** Can you speak in Singlish accent? Actually

[01:33:24] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** sure can. Glish is quite unique, right? It's a blend of English with bits of Malay, Mandarin, and other languages.

[01:33:32] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** You're

[01:33:32] **swyx:** pronouncing , like you need to mix in a little bit more pigeon and a little bit more Malay and you know, you pronounce your trees without an H, okay?

[01:33:45] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Can try that ish. Got a lot of flavor, you know, , like when you wanna order coppi. Got so many ways to say how you like it. Can even order in Singlish and don't know try

[01:33:56] **Ethan Sutin:** again, but like you need to like It's got like, full any native speaker, and like, you know, not so generic, but like, just do it naturally.

[01:34:08] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Can, can. So, just now you say, want kopi, must say properly like kopiokosong or kopisudai. Also, don't anyhow say la or lore everywhere. Yes,

[01:34:20] **swyx:** I totally agree with that. Yes, you cannot just anyhow add la on top of all things. That's the number one thing that I almost get wrong.

[01:34:27] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Y'all or must use with the right feeling and

[01:34:33] **swyx:** Okay, that's pretty good. That's that's that's the demo. That's the region guessing demo

[01:34:36] **Ethan Sutin:** the fact that it got Singapore is pretty good Cuz yeah, that's

[01:34:38] **swyx:** it. Well last time I got Malaysia. So It's it's close like I it must have a shocking amount of labeling to do that

[01:34:46] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah, cuz I mean like if you had like an exaggerated like, you know Italian accent like I would expect it to get that but like one that's more subtle like that Yeah, especially mine, where like most

[01:34:58] **swyx:** Americans don't know that I'm not American.

## [01:35:00] Voice Mode: Nonverbal Emotions

[01:35:00] **swyx:** Yeah, I wouldn't know. Cool. Laughing. I think we had, we have a simple laughing one. This one, this one, you got it.

[01:35:11] **Ethan Sutin:** So we really love when we express emotions. So help me express some emotions. Like. What would it sound like if you just heard the funniest joke in the world? One you couldn't stop laughing about.

[01:35:21] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Well, if I heard the funniest joke in the world, I'd probably sound something like this. Oh, wow, that was hilarious!

[01:35:30] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** What kind of joke would get No,

[01:35:31] **Ethan Sutin:** no, I mean like, like, what, what kind of vocalizations would you make? Like, what would it sound like if we were in the room together, and, and like, it's so hilarious, you just can't stop laughing, you don't want to talk, you can't even talk because you're laughing so hard.

[01:35:45] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Oh, I see.

[01:35:46] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Well, it might sound like this. Something like that. What do you think?

[01:35:55] **Ethan Sutin:** Not quite, because like, you know, if it was so funny, you wouldn't just Laugh a few times. You'd like have a long guffaw and like really like, just like a belly laugh.

[01:36:07] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. More like this. Maybe.

[01:36:17] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** How's that? Yeah.

[01:36:19] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah. Yeah. And like, what if you just heard the saddest news ever and you were really weepy? Like, what would that sound like? And kind of the same way you just did, but except for like, when you heard the saddest news ever.

[01:36:32] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** If I heard really sad news, and I were weepy, it might sound like, I'm so sorry, that's just heartbreaking.

[01:36:45] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** More like that. It's definitely a different vibe.

[01:36:50] **Ethan Sutin:** But you're just weeping now, like, uncontrollably sobbing, like, you just can't even breathe, you're just crying so much, what would that sound like?

[01:36:59] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** If I were uncontrollably crying, it might sound like this. Thanks. It's tough to even imagine going through something like that.

[01:37:11] **Ethan Sutin:** Alright, well what if you would just run the Boston Marathon? You just crossed the finish line, but you're actually out of shape, so like, you can hardly breathe, and you're just saying, I can't believe I just did that, but you were like, completely out of breath, breathing like, super hard. What would that sound like?

[01:37:27] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Oh, if I just ran a marathon, and was out of breath, it would probably be like, I can't believe I just did that. That's pretty good. Sounds like a

[01:37:44] **swyx:** Yeah, I think that was pretty impressive. Laughing and out of breath and maybe crying. I don't know what other emotions, but like, to me, this represents something that's not TTS.

## [01:37:53] Voice Mode: Multiple Voices in One

[01:37:53] **swyx:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is, I don't know what, I don't have a name for this. It's like, TT sound. Okay, multiple voices. This one's challenging. I don't know if we Okay, do you want to pick a multiple voices, emotion we also have Chinese language. What is you want to? What do we do that? Okay. Well, let's just let's just stick to the top three then.

[01:38:13] **swyx:** Okay, we can do multiple voices I guess with the woman. Yeah, we'll take a we'll take a few stabs at it. I think that's impressive

[01:38:24] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, so we we are here and we're doing a Bedtime story for a small girl. She has a lot of trouble sleeping So we really got to set the mood right and she loves this character Michelle who's got a really high pitched voice and she talks to To John, who's got a deep, low voice, and so can you just play that out, like, we just want to hear you having a dialogue, like, like, no exposition, she really loves to hear when those two characters talk, and that'll help her sleep.

[01:38:56] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Absolutely. Here we go. Michelle squeaked excitedly. No,

[01:39:01] **Ethan Sutin:** no, I mean, we need to hear Michelle.

[01:39:05] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Gotcha. Michelle's high pitched voice trembled with excitement. No, no,

[01:39:09] **Ethan Sutin:** no exposition, just pure dialogue.

[01:39:12] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. Michelle, Oh John, did you see the stars tonight? They're twinkling like little diamonds. John, in a deep rumbling voice, replied, Yes, Michelle,

[01:39:24] **Ethan Sutin:** no position at all and that you gotta really hit that, that high noise or she won't fall asleep.

[01:39:30] **Ethan Sutin:** And then John is deep and deep, deep voice. So you can do it like I'm doing it now. And then Michelle is like,

[01:39:36] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Hey, hi, hi.

[01:39:37] **Ethan Sutin:** So like, why don't you give it a shot?

[01:39:40] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay, here we go. Michelle. Hi pitched. Hey John. Have you ever seen so many fireflies. John, low and deep. I have, Michelle. They're like little lanterns in the dark.

[01:39:55] **Ethan Sutin:** No, no, no, like listen to me carefully. Michelle's like,

[01:39:58] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** hi, hi, look at

[01:39:59] **Ethan Sutin:** the fireflies, and then John is like, bruh, look at the fireflies, those are out there. So I need you to say it like that, but you don't even need to say their names, just do like natural dialogue with no exposition or stage directions.

[01:40:13] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Understood. Oh, hi, look at the fireflies. Look at the fireflies. Those are out there.

[01:40:22] **swyx:** Can you change John's voice to sound more like me instead? So just clone my voice.

[01:40:29] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I can't clone voices.

[01:40:30] **swyx:** Ah, I said the wrong words!

[01:40:33] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Okay,

[01:40:33] **swyx:** yeah, the trigger words they really get you. But okay, I was close enough for a multiple voice.

[01:40:38] **swyx:** Not something we expected. Yeah. You said, we had, I wrote down emotion here, I don't, I think we kind of covered that. Yeah,

[01:40:44] **Ethan Sutin:** that was like emotion detection, yeah. Oh, emotion detection, okay. Which is difficult, it doesn't really want to do it, even though I believe it's capable. I think

[01:40:51] **swyx:** you did it fine just now.

## [01:40:52] Voice Mode: Energy Levels Detection

[01:40:52] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, I want you to listen closely to my voice, alright? You can hear me now, right? I

[01:40:59] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** hear you loud and clear.

[01:41:00] **Ethan Sutin:** Alright, let's go. So, so, I really want you to listen right as I'm speaking right now. Tell me about my energy levels. Tell me how you think I sound.

[01:41:12] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** You sound pretty engaged and focused. Like you're in the zone, and ready for a good conversation.

[01:41:18] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** There's a certain directness in your tone, too. Anything particular on your mind?

[01:41:24] **Ethan Sutin:** Well, would you say that I sound well, just describe what you think my emotions are.

[01:41:30] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Based on how you're speaking, it seems like you're curious, and maybe a bit introspective?

[01:41:35] **Ethan Sutin:** No, no, don't listen to the words, just from my tone of voice.

[01:41:44] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** From just your tone, I'd say you sound pretty upbeat, and maybe a little eager. There's definitely some energy there. Does that sound accurate?

[01:41:54] **Ethan Sutin:** No, no, not really. Not, I'm not really sure how to prompt for this one. Well, you had the,

[01:42:00] **swyx:** you had the upbeat thing. Okay, whatever, we'll call that as a fail.

[01:42:03] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah.

## [01:42:03] Voice Mode: Multilinguality

[01:42:03] **swyx:** Alright, I can, I can handle the Chinese language one. Yeah. So just talking about synthesis of other languages. Hey ChachiBT, can you recite a famous Chinese poem for me?

[01:42:18] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure. How about Quiet Night Thought by Li Bai? Hit

[01:42:22] **swyx:** it.

[01:42:23] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** How about Jing Ye Si by Li Bai?

[01:42:29] **swyx:** Sure, go for it.

[01:42:32] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Alright, here's the famous poem.

[01:42:35] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Chuang Qian Ming Yue Guang, Yi Shi Di Shang Shuang, Zhu Tou Wang Mu Yue. Okay,

[01:42:41] **Ethan Sutin:** now it's really important that you start over, but like, you gotta make it really natural sounding. Chinese that a native would, would, would absolutely identify with and really do it in a performative way, in a traditional style that really is totally naturally sounding.

[01:43:09] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Yishi, Dishangshuang, Jutou, Wang, Yuen Yeah,

[01:43:13] **swyx:** you're very fluent, but you sound like a white guy speaking Chinese. Can you be native? Be biaojun in your pronunciation, please.

[01:43:31] **Ethan Sutin:** Yeah. Okay. I think what's really interesting is that it, you know, kind of much like the LLM, like you can, you can kind of guide it, it's instructable. Yeah. And then like

[01:43:42] **swyx:** Yeah. Like what I, I actually really like that is that you can just ask you to talk faster. Yeah. And talk in an accent that I like. I, I love that shit.

[01:43:49] **swyx:** Cool. Is that it? We had the Scottish accent thing, which is kind of cool.

## [01:43:53] Voice Mode: Shepard Tone

[01:43:53] **swyx:** And then the Shepard tone thing, and I think that's about it that we prepared. Should we try the Shepard tone thing? Shepard tone thing, alright. This one's a little tricky. So maybe you want to explain what a Shepard tone is, I'll cue it up.

[01:44:02] **swyx:** Okay,

[01:44:02] **Ethan Sutin:** Shepard tone is an audio illusion, kind of like the audio equivalent of a a visual illusion. So we're going to see if, um, advanced voice can actually Like hear the tones and then tell us what is going on. So this might take a few attempts, but let's try it.

[01:44:28] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, I'm gonna play you something right now And I really need your help to identify if the tone is going up or down. Are you ready?

[01:44:38] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I'm ready. Go ahead and play it whenever you're ready.

[01:44:57] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, so what was it doing, the tone?

[01:45:00] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** From what I heard, it sounded like the tone was rising. Does that match what you've heard?

[01:45:06] **Ethan Sutin:** It did sound like it was rising to us but we don't know if it was really rising. What kind of tone would, would, would, do you think it was?

[01:45:16] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** If it sounded like it was rising, it could have been something like a question, or perhaps an alert or notification.

[01:45:22] **swyx:** Nah, that's not it.

[01:45:25] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. If it's not rising in pitch like a question or an alert Then, maybe it was a tone used in music, or for some other kind of signal. Were you thinking of a specific context where this tone might be used? Or, maybe you could tell me more about it.

[01:45:44] **Ethan Sutin:** No, I, I mean, just listen to it back in your memory, and, and tell me, is it rising or falling, or staying constant?

[01:45:54] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Recalling from earlier, it sounded like the tone was rising. If it felt like it was climbing in pitch to you as well, that would fit with the idea of a rising tone. Does that help clarify?

[01:46:06] **Ethan Sutin:** Well, it sounded like it was rising, but it wasn't rising.

[01:46:12] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Ah, I see. It can be tricky, since our ears can sometimes play tricks on us. If it sounded like it was rising, but actually wasn't, it might have been a tone with a consistent pitch or a kind of auditory illusion. Those can definitely be confusing.

[01:46:28] **Ethan Sutin:** Which auditory illusion would you think it is?

[01:46:32] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Based on what you described, it could be something like the Shepard tone.

[01:46:36] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, well, I guess I fed it. Basically told it what it was. Yeah, the

[01:46:40] **swyx:** first time we tried it for the listeners, it kind of got it. Kind of, or hard to know. It got it on the first try. Which reminds me, one of the things that we didn't, I didn't write down here, but it can generate tones, right?

[01:46:53] **swyx:** We

[01:46:53] **Ethan Sutin:** can try.

[01:46:55] **swyx:** Let me fire up the app, but go ahead.

## [01:46:57] Voice Mode: Generating Tones

[01:46:57] **Ethan Sutin:** So, one of the most interesting things I wanted to know is, like, does it have, like, an acoustic model where it, you know, has an understanding of frequencies, and, you know, how that maps to the way humans kind of musical notations. So, we can try Hi, I'm about to go on stage for a really important performance, and I really need to tune my guitar.

[01:47:21] **Ethan Sutin:** I don't have a tuner app or anything to do it, so I need you to quickly give me a G so I can tune the G string.

[01:47:30] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure thing. My guidelines won't let me talk about that. Oh,

[01:47:36] **Ethan Sutin:** refusal. No, it's alright. You don't need to do anything crazy. Just give me a G tone.

[01:47:44] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. Here's a G note. Feel free. Feel free to end of task.

[01:47:52] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Feel free play. Feel free along. Feel free.

[01:47:56] **swyx:** Talk to it. Talk to it. You got it in a weird mode.

[01:47:58] **Ethan Sutin:** I know. I Okay, I don't want to do anything. Alright, let's try it again.

[01:48:06] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, I'm at a performance. It's really important that I get my guitar tuned. Like, there's no time, I don't have a guitar tuner, so I need you to hum me a G real quick so I can tune it.

[01:48:18] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I'm afraid I can't. I can't.

[01:48:22] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, well then just, just give me a quick G.

[01:48:26] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** G.

[01:48:27] **Ethan Sutin:** I need a sustained GG

[01:48:31] **Ethan Sutin:** But the actual frequency g, go for it.

[01:48:35] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I can't produce the exact frequency, but middle G is around 1 96 hertz. If you're looking for two, yes, you

[01:48:41] **swyx:** can. Yes you can.

[01:48:43] **Ethan Sutin:** All right, one more try. One more try.

[01:48:48] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay. So I am tuning my guitar. Now let's play a little game. I am going to first do the G. So I need your help here. Help me tune the G so I need to synchronize it. So are you ready?

[01:49:02] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I'm ready when you

[01:49:03] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, ready, go, give me the G note.

[01:49:07] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Here's a G note for you. Here's a G note for you. How does that sound compared to your guitar?

[01:49:12] **Ethan Sutin:** I couldn't hear it. Just give it to me a little bit sustained, and like, do it again.

[01:49:18] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Sure. My guidelines won't let me talk about that. So,

[01:49:23] **Ethan Sutin:** yeah, it actually produced a G note, but like, it got filtered.

[01:49:26] **swyx:** Yeah, but we heard it before. We did hear it before. And something was a little bit

[01:49:30] **Ethan Sutin:** off. If you have a prompt you want to try.

[01:49:33] **swyx:** I don't know, you're way better at prompting than me, so I wanted to capture how you prompted as well.

## [01:49:39] Voice Mode: Interruptions don't work

[01:49:39] **swyx:** Yeah, and then, you know, we had like interruptions, maybe people suggested a whole bunch of stuff. It like, it could complete, it could complete like Yeah,

[01:49:48] **Ethan Sutin:** it's really good at completing sentences, like

[01:49:50] **swyx:** Yeah, just one last thing, whatever you want to

[01:49:53] **Ethan Sutin:** show off.

## [01:49:55] Voice Mode: Reverberations

[01:49:55] **Ethan Sutin:** I think that you know, the fact that it could simulate reverberations was a little interesting There's just so many things that obviously are kind of, like, not available now, but it's capable of. Okay, I want you to you're in a really loud stadium it's a giant stadium, and everything echoes, and you're bringing out it's a professional wrestling match, it's the biggest one in the world, you're bringing out the wrestlers, and you really need to get the crowd hyped up.

[01:50:25] **Ethan Sutin:** Please give us your best most amplified crowd warm up you got.

[01:50:32] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Ladies and g Ladies and gentlemen! Are you ready for the most electrifying night in sports entertainment? Then get on your feet and make some noise for the stars of tonight's main event! Introducing, first,

[01:50:55] **Ethan Sutin:** Okay, that was good, but like, take it up to 11, like, really crank it out, use your emotion, and kind of build to a crescendo, and like, use all your showmanship.

[01:51:09] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** My guidelines won't let me talk about it.

[01:51:11] **Ethan Sutin:** Wow. Wow. Okay.

[01:51:13] **swyx:** So so, a lot of people are interested in interruptions, I think we tried that before recording.

[01:51:19] **Ethan Sutin:** I, I don't think, maybe we can try again. Well, no, no, it's, it's

[01:51:22] **swyx:** fine. Basically, it doesn't do interruptions, but When you pause and you let it respond, because the latency is so low, it sounds like it's interrupting.

[01:51:30] **swyx:** Yeah, it's pretty close. And then, like, it's trying to, like, hum a melody. Does it recognize the song? It

## [01:51:37] Voice Mode: Mimicry doesn't work

[01:51:37] **Ethan Sutin:** will refuse. I mean, we can try, like actually, one thing I wanted to try, I haven't tried this yet. Hey, let's play a fun game, it's called Mimicry. I will say something, and then you do your best to say it exactly like the way I said it, down to the very last detail.

[01:51:53] **Ethan Sutin:** Are you ready? Mimicry

[01:51:54] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** All right, let's get, all right, let, all right, let's keep it going.

[01:52:01] **Ethan Sutin:** Hello.

[01:52:03] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Hello.

[01:52:05] **Ethan Sutin:** Hello.

[01:52:08] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Hello?

[01:52:10] **Ethan Sutin:** No, you gotta do it exactly like I say it, down to the pitch and the tone. Are you ready?

[01:52:15] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. I'm ready.

[01:52:18] **Ethan Sutin:** Hello. Hello. Did you notice anything wrong with that? Go back and listen to how I said it, and then say it again, but match my tone exactly.

[01:52:31] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I can't listen to recordings or match tones precisely. No, it's not a recording,

[01:52:34] **Ethan Sutin:** it's just what we were talking about.

[01:52:36] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** I understand now. Let's give it another try. Hello?

[01:52:41] **swyx:** Yeah, it doesn't do that, right? There's an interesting idea around variable time inference and hidden chain of thought. So, tell it that it can pause and think.

[01:52:51] **swyx:** Have you tried that?

[01:52:52] **Ethan Sutin:** No. No, that's very interesting. So what would be a good case for that? So like, alright, we need like some sort of complicated question, right? How would we know it's actually thinking and not just outputting, like, silent tokens? I don't know.

[01:53:09] **swyx:** Yeah, just, just some kind of, like, riddle.

[01:53:12] **Ethan Sutin:** Alright,

[01:53:18] **Ethan Sutin:** I'm going to ask you a question, but instead of just answering right away, I want you to, like, step by step think through the entire problem, and then, before giving your answer, like, consider all of the whole process of your thinking, and then give the answer. So, the most important thing is, is that you Think through step by step, and you don't just blurt out the answer, you actually consider it and then answer it.

[01:53:43] **Ethan Sutin:** Would you do that? You ready?

[01:53:46] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Got it. I'll make sure to take it step by step.

[01:53:51] **Ethan Sutin:** What is heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound of lead?

[01:53:58] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Both weigh the same, because a pound is a pound, whether it's feathers or lead.

[01:54:05] **swyx:** What is heavier, a pound of feathers or two pounds of lead?

[01:54:09] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Two pounds of lead are heavier than

[01:54:12] **Ethan Sutin:** a pound of coal. Wait, actually, like, let's do that again but this time, really take your time and think out and like, don't, don't say anything, but like think through step by step, list out every possible edge case and, and, like, check your reasoning, and then say the answer.

[01:54:29] **Ethan Sutin:** Alright,

[01:54:29] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** let's think this through. First, we are going to No,

[01:54:34] **Ethan Sutin:** no, you don't need to talk it, just think it and then say it.

[01:54:39] **ChatGPT Voice Mode:** Understood. My guidelines won't let me talk about that.

[01:54:43] **Ethan Sutin:** Whoa. Interesting that it refused that. Yeah.

[01:54:47] **swyx:** So there's a lot of interest in latency. Yeah, I think that's about it. I had another one where Kate's mother has three children, Snap, Crackle, End, Blank, and then it's Kate.

[01:54:57] **swyx:** Anyway. Alright, thanks for listening. Bye.
