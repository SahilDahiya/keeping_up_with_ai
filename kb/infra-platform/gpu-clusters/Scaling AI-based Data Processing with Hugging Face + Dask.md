[Dask](https://www.dask.org/?utm_source=hf-blog), a Python library for distributed computing, can handle out-of-core computing (processing data that doesn’t fit in memory) by breaking datasets into manageable chunks. This makes it easy to do things like:

- Efficient data loading and preprocessing of TB-scale datasets with an easy to use API that mimics pandas
- Parallel model inference (with the option of multi-node GPU inference)

In this post we show an example of data processing from the FineWeb dataset, using the FineWeb-Edu classifier to identify web pages with high educational value. We’ll show:

- How to process 100 rows locally with pandas
- Scaling to 211 million rows with Dask across multiple GPUs on the cloud

The [FineWeb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) consists of 15 trillion tokens of English web data from [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/), a non-profit that hosts a public web crawl dataset updated monthly. This dataset is often used for a variety of tasks such as large language model training, classification, content filtering, and information retrieval across a variety of sectors.

It can take > 1 minute to download and read in a single file with pandas on a laptop.

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet(
    "hf://datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb/data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/000_00000.parquet"
)
```
Next, we’ll use the HF [FineWeb-Edu classifier](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier) to judge the educational value of the web pages in our dataset. Web pages are ranked on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 being not educational and 5 being highly educational. We can use pandas to do this on a smaller, 100-row subset of the data, which takes ~10 seconds on a M1 Mac with a GPU.

```
from transformers import pipeline
def compute_scores(texts):
    import torch
    # Select which hardware to use
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device("cuda")
    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        device = torch.device("mps")
    else:
        device = torch.device("cpu")
    pipe = pipeline(
        "text-classification",
        model="HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier",
        device=device
    )
    results = pipe(
        texts.to_list(),
        batch_size=25,                    # Choose batch size based on data size and hardware
        padding="longest",
        truncation=True,
        function_to_apply="none"
    )
    
    return pd.Series([r["score"] for r in results])
df = df[:100]
min_edu_score = 3
df["edu-classifier-score"] = compute_scores(df.text)
df = df[df["edu-classifier-score"] >= min_edu_score]
```
Note that we also added a step to check the available hardware inside the `compute_scores` function, because it will be distributed when we scale with Dask in the next step. This makes it easy to go from testing locally on a single machine (either on a CPU or maybe you have a MacBook with an Apple silicon GPU) to distributing across multiple machines (like NVIDIA GPUs).

The entire 2024 February/March crawl is 432 GB on disk, or ~715 GB in memory, split up across 250 Parquet files. Even on a machine with enough memory for the whole dataset, this would be prohibitively slow to do serially.

To scale up, we can use [Dask DataFrame](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe.html?utm_source=hf-blog), which helps you process large tabular data by parallelizing pandas. It closely resembles the pandas API, making it easy to go from testing on a single dataset to scaling out to the full dataset. Dask works well with Parquet, the default format on Hugging Face datasets, to enable rich data types, efficient columnar filtering, and compression.

```
import dask.dataframe as dd
df = dd.read_parquet(
    # Load the full dataset lazily with Dask
    "hf://datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb/data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/*.parquet" 
)
```
We’ll apply the `compute_scores` function for text classification in parallel on our Dask DataFrame using `map_partitions`, which applies our function in parallel on each pandas DataFrame in the larger Dask DataFrame. The `meta` argument is specific to Dask, and indicates the data structure (column names and data types) of the output.

```
from transformers import pipeline
def compute_scores(texts):
    import torch
    # Select which hardware to use
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device("cuda")
    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        device = torch.device("mps")
    else:
        device = torch.device("cpu")
    pipe = pipeline(
        "text-classification",
        model="HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier",
        device=device,
    )
    results = pipe(
        texts.to_list(),
        batch_size=768,
        padding="longest",
        truncation=True,
        function_to_apply="none",
    )
    return pd.Series([r["score"] for r in results])
min_edu_score = 3
df["edu-classifier-score"] = df.text.map_partitions(compute_scores, meta=pd.Series([0]))
df = df[df["edu-classifier-score"] >= min_edu_score]
```
Note that we’ve picked a `batch_size` that works well for this example, but you’ll likely want to customize this depending on the hardware, data, and model you’re using in your own workflows (see the [HF docs on pipeline batching](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipeline-batching)).

Now that we’ve identified the rows of the dataset we’re interested in, we can save the result for other downstream analyses. Dask DataFrame automatically supports [distributed writing to Parquet](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe-parquet.html?utm_source=hf-blog). Hugging Face uses commits to track dataset changes and allows writing a Dask DataFrame in parallel.

```
repo_id = "<your-hf-user>/<your-dataset-name>"  # Update with your dataset location
df.to_parquet(f"hf://datasets/{repo_id}")
```
Since this creates one commit per file, it is recommended to squash the history after the upload:

```
from huggingface_hub import HfApi
HfApi().super_squash_history(repo_id=repo_id, repo_type="dataset")
```
Alternatively you can use [this custom function](https://gist.github.com/lhoestq/8f73187a4e4b97b9bb40b561e35f6ccb) which uploads multiple files per commit.

There are a number of ways to [deploy Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/deploying.html?utm_source=hf-blog) on a variety of hardware. Here, we’ll use [Coiled](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/ml.html?utm_source=hf-blog) to deploy Dask on the cloud so we can spin up VMs as needed, and then clean them up when we’re done.

```
cluster = coiled.Cluster(
    region="us-east-1",                 # Same region as data
    n_workers=100,                      
    spot_policy="spot_with_fallback",   # Use spot instances, if available
    worker_vm_types="g5.xlarge",        # NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core GPU
    worker_options={"nthreads": 1},
)
client = cluster.get_client()
```
Under the hood Coiled handles:

- Provisioning cloud VMs with GPU hardware. In this case, `g5.xlarge`[instances on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5/).
- Setting up the appropriate NVIDIA drivers, CUDA runtime, etc.
- Automatically installing the same packages you have locally on the cloud VM with [package sync](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/software/sync.html?utm_source=hf-blog). This includes Python files in your working directory.

The workflow took ~5 hours to complete and we had good GPU hardware utilization.

Putting it all together, here is the complete workflow:

```
import dask.dataframe as dd
from transformers import pipeline
from huggingface_hub import HfApi
import os
import coiled
cluster = coiled.Cluster(
    region="us-east-1",
    n_workers=100,
    spot_policy="spot_with_fallback",
    worker_vm_types="g5.xlarge",
    worker_options={"nthreads": 1},
)
client = cluster.get_client()
cluster.send_private_envs(
    {"HF_TOKEN": "<your-hf-token>"}             #  Send credentials over encrypted connection
)
df = dd.read_parquet(
    "hf://datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb/data/CC-MAIN-2024-10/*.parquet"
)
def compute_scores(texts):
    import torch
    # Select which hardware to use
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device("cuda")
    elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        device = torch.device("mps")
    else:
        device = torch.device("cpu")
    pipe = pipeline(
        "text-classification",
        model="HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-classifier",
        device=device
    )
    results = pipe(
        texts.to_list(),
        batch_size=768,
        padding="longest",
        truncation=True,
        function_to_apply="none"
    )
    return pd.Series([r["score"] for r in results])
min_edu_score = 3
df["edu-classifier-score"] = df.text.map_partitions(compute_scores, meta=pd.Series([0]))
df = df[df["edu-classifier-score"] >= min_edu_score]
repo_id = "<your-hf-user>/<your-dataset-name>"  # Replace with your dataset location
df.to_parquet(f"hf://datasets/{repo_id}")
HfApi().super_squash_history(repo_id=repo_id, repo_type="dataset")  # optional: squash commit history
```
Hugging Face + Dask is a powerful combination. In this example, we scaled up our classification task from 100 rows to 211 million rows by using Dask + Coiled to run the workflow in parallel across multiple GPUs on the cloud.

This same type of workflow can be used for other use cases like:

- Filtering genomic data to select genes of interest
- Extracting information from unstructured text and turning them into structured datasets
- Cleaning text data scraped from the internet or Common Crawl
- Running multimodal model inference to analyze large audio, image, or video datasets
